            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis expoſition of the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> is my own invention, thou ſhalt not meet with it in any other Writer whatſoever. All that I intended at the the firſt was to read over thoſe few Books which I had in my ſtudy upon the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> which I did for my own ſatisfaction, contentation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o ſee what Men did ſay on that Subject. And I did read of ſome which held <hi>Babylon</hi> to be the World, the City of the Devil, or the City of wicked Men, but all others held it to be <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſome would have it to be Heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> and others to be <hi>Papal.</hi> Some have found the Revenues of the <hi>Popedome,</hi> and others the wealth of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and if that were once taken away, the fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> would not be long after, which perhaps might give incouragement to <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> to ſend a Navy to <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> to fetch it away. Some have found <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> the victorious King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> there; and to come nearer home, ſome have found our renowned Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James</hi> of bleſſed memory, yea, and men of meaner rank, Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Prinne,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Baſtwielte</hi> there, and which I count as ſenſcleſs as any of the reſt, <hi>Laodicea, England</hi> as they call it, and <hi>Philadelphia, Scotland</hi> there: And
<pb facs="tcp:180584:4"/>if men will give their minds to myſtical interpretations, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the common ſaying, <hi>quot verba, tot myſteria,</hi> that there be as many myſteries as words in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> what is it that one may not find there? Some for ſake our Church Aſſemblies, and judge them to be <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> and fetch a warrant for their ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration out of the <hi>Revelation, Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues, Rev. 18.4.</hi> Yea, a great in-let to our late Civil Wars, hath been the miſinterpretation of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and ſome men did believe that that War was Propheſied of, <hi>Rev. 17.16.</hi> When I found that men were of this mind, my ſpirit was moved within me, not only to read what men did Write, but to ſtudy the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> as the men of <hi>Berea</hi> did the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, to ſee whether thoſe things which they did write upon this ſubject were ſo, or no. And upon ſerious examination of the point, I call in queſtion all the myſtical interpretations of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> excepting thoſe few which <hi>John</hi> himſelf hath delivered for ſuch, or are ſo obvious that he that runs may read them, as when 'tis ſaid, <hi>When the Lamb hath opened the firſt Seal,</hi> every Child can tell that by the <hi>Lamb</hi> is meant <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſuch as theſe are myſtically to be underſtood, but all others that be not of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are called in queſtion by me. And I put it out of queſtion that our Church Aſſemblies be not <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> nor our <hi>Biſhops, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians.</hi> A man may frequent our Church Aſſemblies, or be a Miniſter of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and not partake of <hi>Babylons</hi> ſins, and receive not of her Plagues: Yea, I make a queſtion what the City of <hi>Babylon</hi> is, and whatever myſtical interpretations have been made of that and other Prophecies, beſides thoſe which the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> hath made himſelf, or are ſo apparent, that every one at firſt ſight may know them to be ſuch, are called in queſtion by me, whether they be the true meaning of the Prophecies; and I give a new interpretation of the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Writers knew not of, nor ever came into their minds. And
<pb facs="tcp:180584:4"/>this I do, firſt, by way of Paraphraſe, wherein I deliver the true ſenſe and meaning of the Prophecies, without giving reaſons for my expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and next I add divers queſtions, wherein I firſt diſpute againſt the falſe opinions and conceits of other men, and demonſtrate by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers arguments and reaſons, that the Prophecies have not ſuch a meaning, were not fulfilled in ſuch a way, ſuch a manner, at ſuch a time, and in ſuch a place as they ſay they were; and after this is done, in ſome queſtion or other I give the reaſons for my own expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In a word, the main points wherein I differ and diſſent from other men, may be reduced to four Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Whereas other men expound the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> myſtically, according to the common ſaying, <hi>quot verba, tot myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> as many myſteries as words, making them ſymbols, types, and figures of other things; I for the moſt part, and ſo far as lawfully I may, expound the words literally, without making them ſymbols, types, or figures of any other things than what their uſual fignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will afford.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Whereas others will have the accompliſhment of the Prophecies to be in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> I make the Scene in which the Prophecies ſhall be acted and fulfilled to be <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Whereas other men will not have the Prophecies commence in order as they were revealed to <hi>John,</hi> I make them all come to paſs in order as they were revealed to him, and I make the order give light to the expoſition, and not the expoſition to the order; and I ſay the order teacheth how the Prophecies are to be explained and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and not the expoſition in what order they ſhall come to paſs.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> Whereas others are of the mind that the Prophecies which I write upon, are for the moſt part fulfilled already; I am of opinion that all, and every one of them are yet to be expected.</p>
            <p>If I diſcover the truth unto thee, as I believe I do in moſt things, if not in all; give God the glory, and not me; but of thou find that I am in an errour, as none that have written upon this

               </gap>e are without; convince me of my errour by ſound reaſons, for bare votes will not do it, and I will be of thy mind. Read what is written at thy leaſure, and conſider of it; but read it in order and without prejudice, for that will cloud thine Eyes and thou wilt not ſee the truth; if thou read the Book with prejudice, weigh one thing with another, as well the ſeries and order of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as the words and expoſition of them, and the Lord who is the Author of the Prophecy and revealed it to <hi>John,</hi> reveal the truth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, Farewell.</p>

This Book was written after the Seven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> were converted to the Chriſtian Faith: But we cannot find that theſe Seven Churches were converted to the Faith in the dayes of <hi>Claudius,</hi> but 'tis more likely that <hi>Epheſus</hi> was converted in the dayes of <hi>Nero,</hi> and that becauſe, as Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> obſerves pag. 648. the firſt time that <hi>Paul</hi> diſputed at <hi>Epheſus</hi> was about Ann.

But now the Goſpel had been Preached unto them a long time before this Book was written, and they were not new converts, but old ones, and of long ſtanding in the Chriſtian Faith, when this Book was written to them, as theſe Texts of Scripture ſufficiently declare, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2, 3, 4, 5.9.13.19.21.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. If this Book had been written in the ninth year of <hi>Claudius, Paul</hi> would not have gone to <hi>Epheſus</hi> to Preach the Goſpel there at the latter end of his Reign, for <hi>Paul</hi> did not Preach the Goſpel where it had been Preached: before by others, as he himſelf confeſſeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.20, 21. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13, 14, 15, 16. Now we find that <hi>Paul</hi> went to Preach the Goſpel at <hi>Epheſus</hi> before it was converted, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.19. and this was at the latter end of <hi>Claudius</hi>'s Reign, for his going thither was, as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in his Preface before the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> ſaith, about the one and fiftieth year of Chriſt, and that was at the latter end of <hi>Claudius</hi>'s Reign, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Book was not written then, but at ſome time or other afterward.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Why was this Book revealed unto <hi>John,</hi> and not rather unto <hi>Paul,</hi> for <hi>Paul</hi> was the Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> of the circumciſion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9. and <hi>Paul</hi> had the honour to convert the Gentiles to the Chriſtian Faith, not <hi>John,</hi> as you may read in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, <hi>c.</hi> 18.19. and 20. and therefore it is likely that if this Prophecy had been reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the days of <hi>Paul,</hi> that it ſhould have been revealed unto him, and that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould have been the pen-man of it, and not <hi>John,</hi> which we know is otherwiſe; and therefore the true cauſe, why this Prophecy was revealed unto <hi>John,</hi> and not to <hi>Paul,</hi> was becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> was dead, and the other Apoſtles were dead when this Prophecy was revealed, and onely

That <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in that place, is a writing againſt the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taniſts</hi> about the authority of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> and that the later it were ſeen, or written, the more it would have been for his turn, towards confuting, or anſwering them, whoſe objection it was that the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſe,</hi> was not yet a Church, when that was ſaid to be revealed. And therefore if it had been but uncertain, whether it were written ſo early or no, he would without all queſtion, have made uſe of this as ſome advantage againſt his adverſaries, whom
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:180584:10"/>he was then in confuting, 2. That <hi>Epiphanius</hi> is ſo far from doing this, that he doth twice in the ſame place expreſly affirm, 1. That his being in the Iſle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> 2. That his ſeeing theſe Viſions there, were in the time of <hi>Claudius.</hi>

If there be any truth in <hi>Epiphanius</hi>'s Teſtimony, why did <hi>Jerom, Euſebius,</hi> and others follow the Teſtimony of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and not the Teſtimony of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> but that they ſaw ſome fault in his Teſtimony? yea, why did all our modern Writers ſince, as well Papiſts as Proteſtants (except <hi>Grotius</hi> and his adherents) follow the Teſtimony of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and forſake the Teſtimony of <hi>Epiphanius?</hi> if there were any credit to be given to his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony. 3. Either the Copy of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> is corrupt, or elſe he miſtook and ſet down <hi>Claudius</hi> for <hi>Domitian,</hi> as the margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal note <hi>mendoſè pro Domitiano</hi> doth imply, and he might as well miſtake <hi>Claudius,</hi> for <hi>Domitian,</hi> as he did <hi>Priſcilla, Maximilla,</hi> and <hi>Quintilla,</hi> for <hi>Jeſebel,</hi> for he thinks that by <hi>Jeſebel</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle meant <hi>Priſcilla, Maximilla,</hi> and <hi>Quintilla,</hi> which is a very unlikely thing, for <hi>Ieſebel</hi> was a woman then in being, though of another name when the Apoſtle wrote the Epiſtle to the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> and he called her <hi>Ieſebel</hi> by a Metaphor, for the likeneſs ſhe bore to <hi>Ieſebel, Ahabs</hi> Wife, in wickedneſs, witchcraft, Adultery, and Idolatry, whenas <hi>Priſcilla, Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imilla,</hi> and <hi>Quintilla</hi> the Diſciples of <hi>Montanus,</hi> were not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſſes till the latter end of <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> which was many years after <hi>Claudius,</hi> and <hi>Domitian</hi> too. 4.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:180584:11"/>it would have been for his turn, it is nothing ſo, for he makes the Epiſtle to the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> to be a Prophecy of a Church then to come, and not a Hiſtory of a Church that then was, in which regard it made nothing to his turn, whether it were written ſooner, or later; for ſuppoſe it were written ſooner in <hi>Claudius</hi>'s time, and that there were no Church in <hi>Thyatira</hi> at that time, it made nothing againſt him, nor againſt the authority of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> if the Epiſtle be meant Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically of a Church then to come, as he underſtood it; or ſuppoſe it were written later in <hi>Domitians</hi> time, and that there were no Church at <hi>Thyatira</hi> in his time neither, it made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt him, and his way, nor againſt the authority of the <hi>Revelation</hi> neither, if the Epiſtle be to be underſtood pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically of a Church to come, as he underſtood it: but the truth is, there was no Church at <hi>Thyatira</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Claudius,</hi> nor in any other part of <hi>Aſia, Act.</hi> 16.6. much leſs ſuch renowned Churches as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaks of, conſiſting of Elders, Biſhops, and Metropolitans too, as ſome would have it, and therefore this Book was not written in his days, but at ſome time or other afterward, Laſtly, if the Epiſtle to the Church of <hi>Thyatira</hi> were written in the days of <hi>Claudius,</hi> how will they anſwer the objection of the <hi>Montaniſts,</hi> which was, that there was no Church there when that Epiſtle was written, as indeed there was not, if that Epiſtle were written in <hi>Claudius</hi>'s days.</p>

And therefore <hi>Baronius,</hi> that is for his baniſhment under <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> in the tenth year of his Reign, is forced fairly to reject <hi>Tertullians</hi> authority in this matter, giving for it his proof out of <hi>Dio, viz.</hi> that <hi>Nerva</hi> releaſed thoſe who were condemned of impiety, and reſtored thoſe who were baniſhed. Which affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of <hi>Dio</hi>'s being granted as far as belongs to thoſe who were in exile, or ſtood condemned at <hi>Nerva</hi>'s coming to the Empire, doth no way prejudice the truth of <hi>Tertullians</hi> words, of <hi>Domitians</hi> having repreſſed his ſeverity againſt the Chriſtians, and revoked the baniſhed, (wherein he is much a more compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent witneſs than <hi>Baronius.</hi>) No more doth his killing his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle <hi>Clemens,</hi> and baniſhing his Couſin <hi>Flavia Domitilla,</hi> for that was five years after this time of <hi>Johns</hi> ſuppoſed baniſhment, in the fifteenth or laſt year of <hi>Domitians</hi> Reign.

If <hi>Domitian</hi> preſently ceaſed from his cruelty, and recalled the baniſhed, why did Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſay, that after the rebuilding of the <hi>Capitol Domitian</hi> began a perſecution againſt the Chriſtians, as thoſe which oppoſed the Heathen Worſhip, and continued it above three years and a half, until his death? Paraph. on <hi>Revelation</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>pag.</hi> 967. 3.

If <hi>Domitian</hi> began his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution in the tenth year of his Reign, and preſently ceaſed from it, how came it to paſs that in the fifteenth year of his Reign, he ſlew <hi>Flavius Clemens,</hi> (who had been a Conſul) for his <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and baniſhed <hi>Flavia Domitilla</hi> for being a Chriſtian? doth not this plainly ſhew that <hi>Domitian</hi> continued his perſecution againſt the Church; and never wholly ceaſed from it? though for a while he might relent, and be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs at one time than another, as a continued feaver hath its time of relaxation, and exacerbation, yet never wholly ceaſeth. 5. If <hi>Domitian</hi> preſently ceaſed from his perſecution, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver took it up again, this had been no grand perſecution, as all the ten perſecutions were, but a very light one, even the lighteſt that ever was. 6. That relenting which <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks of, may very well agree with that which <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith, for he might ceaſe from his cruelty for a time, and take it up again, as a continual feaver doth relent for a time, and have a ſtrong fit again: but I rather think that that ceaſing which <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks of, was in the fifteenth year of his Reign, not long before his death; and whereas 'tis ſaid he ceaſed preſently, the meaning is, not that he ceaſed preſently after he firſt began his perſecution, but the meaning rather is, that he ceaſed preſently after he heard the words of <hi>Judes</hi> Sons, that Chriſts Kingdom was not earthly, but heavenly, this was it which made him to relent, and this was done at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of his Reign, whenas his perſecution began about five years before, and this doth well agree with that which <hi>Dio</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Nerva</hi> releaſed thoſe who where condemned of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, and reſtored thoſe who were baniſhed, <hi>Domitian</hi> not living himſelf to ſee it put in execution. Laſtly, that which <hi>Egeſippus</hi> ſaith, doth very well agree with that which <hi>Euſebius</hi>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:180584:13"/>ſaith, for 'twas at the latter end of his Reign that the Sons of <hi>Jude</hi> were brought before him, and when he found them to be plain men, and ſuch as believed not <hi>Chriſts</hi> Kingdom to be of this World, he thereupon ſet them free, and there were no more ſet free by him than they, and more than this he did not, but made an Edict that the perſecution againſt the Church ſhould ceaſe, and this edict reached not the <hi>Jews</hi> only, as <hi>Baronius</hi> would have it, but the whole Church, but <hi>Domitian</hi> dying ſuddenly thereupon, no more was done in his days but the making of the edict only, all the reſt was put in execution by <hi>Nerva;</hi> in his days it was that the Sons of <hi>Jude</hi> became Biſhops in the Church, and not before; in his days it was that peace was reſtored, and not before; and in his days it was that <hi>John</hi> was releaſed, and not before: and upon this account it is, that it was not done in <hi>Domitians</hi> days, becauſe <hi>Domitian</hi> died ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after he heard the words of <hi>Judes</hi> Sons, and was ſlain by <hi>Stephen,</hi> and did not live to ſee his edict put in execution.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:180584:13"/>have involved St. <hi>John</hi> there. And accordingly <hi>Chronologers</hi> have placed this baniſhment of his to <hi>Patmos</hi> in that year.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> That the Chriſtians were purſued, and baniſhed by the <hi>Roman Powers</hi> about the ninth year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> doth not yet appear to me, for as <hi>yet there was law made againſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion,</hi> ſaith Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi> paraph. on <hi>Act.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 15. and a little after he ſaith, that Claudius <hi>ſet out an Edict againſt the</hi> Jews, <hi>but none againſt Chriſtians, any otherwiſe than as they were comprehended under the name of</hi> Jews. 2. That edict ſet forth by <hi>Claudius,</hi> in the ninth year of his Reign, was againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> only, and not againſt the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and <hi>the Chriſtian Jews,</hi> as <hi>Jews, not as Chriſtians fell under that edict,</hi> ſaith the ſame Doctor, notes on <hi>Act.</hi> 26. <hi>pag.</hi> 456. 3.

The Ringleader of theſe tumults was one <hi>Chreſtus,</hi> as <hi>Suetonius</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 25. but that by <hi>Chre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> is meant our Lord <hi>Chriſt, adhuc mihi perſuadere non poſſum, I cannot yet perſwade my ſelf,</hi> ſaith Biſhop <hi>

                     </gap> another Argument that by <hi>Chrestus</hi> he doth not mean <hi>Christ,</hi> but it is very likely that that name came up after he was dead, and that through ignorance of the common people. 6. Theſe tumults were raiſed <hi>impulſore Chresto</hi> by the impulſion of <hi>Chrestus;</hi> now what is meant by impulſion but <hi>verbum &amp; exemplum</hi> his winning words, and leading example? and this alſo ſhews that <hi>Chrestus</hi> was not <hi>Christ,</hi> but a man then alive, and one that lived in <hi>Rome</hi> at that time, elſe he could not ſtir up theſe tumults, <hi>verbo &amp; exemplo</hi> by his winning words, and leading example, as this <hi>Chrestus</hi> did. 7. But ſuppoſe it to be true, that by <hi>Chrestus</hi> he means <hi>Christ,</hi> yet it will not ſerve their turn, for the exile which <hi>Suetonius</hi> ſpeaks of, is of ſuch as were at <hi>Rome</hi> at that time, <hi>Judaeos Româ expulit, he baniſhed the</hi> Jews <hi>out of</hi> Rome, and St. <hi>Luke</hi> hath the ſame expreſſion of the place, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.2. Claudius <hi>commanded all</hi> Jews <hi>to depart from</hi> Rome, but how doth it appear that St. <hi>John</hi> was then at <hi>Rome?</hi> for unleſs he were there at that time, how is he concerned in the exile? 8. But let us ſuppoſe as they do, that that edict went farther than <hi>Rome,</hi> and did reach thoſe that were at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> how doth it appear that St. <hi>John</hi> was then at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus?</hi> for unleſs he were there at that time he is ſtill uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the exile. And here by the way the Reader may obſerve that they ſuppoſe <hi>John</hi> to be at <hi>Epheſus</hi> at that time, and that the edict did reach him there, both which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect they ſhould prove, and make good before we can conſent unto it, that <hi>John</hi> was baniſhed by <hi>Claudius</hi> into <hi>Patmos.</hi> 9. But though they bring no Argument for it, I will advance an
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:180584:14"/>Argument or two againſt it, If that edict did reach to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and involve <hi>John</hi> there, how came it to paſs that it did not reach to <hi>Corinth,</hi> which is nearer <hi>Rome</hi> than <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> but ſuffer him to continue there, and Preach the Goſpel there, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. 10. If that edict did baniſh <hi>John</hi> from <hi>Epheſus,</hi> how came it to paſs that <hi>Paul</hi> went to <hi>Epheſus</hi> a little afterward, and was not ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed too, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.19, 20? 11. The <hi>Jews</hi> were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that edict to depart from <hi>Rome,</hi> but not confined to any certain place, as <hi>John</hi> was, and after they were gone from thence, they were at liberty to reſide where they would, as appears by <hi>Aquila</hi>'s going to <hi>Corinth,</hi> and reſiding there, where he was at liberty, to continue or remove from thence to any other place except <hi>Rome,</hi> as he pleaſed, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.2, 3.18, 19. So was not <hi>Johns</hi> confinement unto <hi>Patmos,</hi> from whence he had not liberty to remove to a more commodious place, but was forced to continue there againſt his will. 13. The Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was planted by <hi>Paul,</hi> as appears, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. and confirmed by <hi>John,</hi> as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaith, l. 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>Euſebius,</hi> l. 3. <hi>c.</hi> 20. and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> was there before <hi>John,</hi> and when <hi>John</hi> came thither he confirmed what <hi>Paul</hi> had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but if <hi>John</hi> were at <hi>Epheſus</hi> at that time, when that edict came forth from <hi>Claudius,</hi> he muſt have been there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul,</hi> for <hi>Paul</hi> had not been there at that time, but came thither afterward, and found no Church there, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.1, 2.19, 20, 21. <hi>Act.</hi> 19.1, 2.

Ioh.</hi> 12.12. Why do they not ſay that this Book
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:180584:15"/>was written then? 2. Did not <hi>Chriſt</hi> foretel the deſtruction of the <hi>Iews</hi> in his time, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.2. &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.24. and did not he ſay unto them, <hi>When ye ſee theſe things begin to come to paſs, then look up and lift up your heads, for your redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption draweth near, Luk.</hi> 21.28. And if the <hi>Revelation</hi> were written to comfort the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> againſt the <hi>Iews,</hi> and aſſure them that thoſe perſecutions of the <hi>Iews</hi> ſhould be ſhortly ended by their deſtruction, (as they ſay it was) Why do they not think that it was written then? 3. Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> take notice of the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, c.</hi> 5.3, 4, 5, 6.<note place="margin">not any of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles nor of the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten about the ninth year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> but afterward.</note> as well as in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians c.</hi> 6.12. and were not both theſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles and many others of his where the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> are taken notice of, written after the days of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius?</hi> and why may not the <hi>Revelation</hi> be written after his days too? 4. Did not the <hi>Iews</hi> perſecute <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in <hi>Domitians</hi> time, and were there not <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> at that time too, <hi>Menander, Baſilides</hi> and others, and why do they not think that this Book was written then? In a word, the perſecution of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the complying of the <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks</hi> to ſave themſelves from perſecution, is no good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſhew the time when the <hi>Revelation</hi> was revealed to <hi>Iohn,</hi> but <hi>Iohn</hi> being in the Iſle of <hi>Patmos</hi> for the word of God, and for the Teſtimony of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> is a characteriſtical note of the time of its revealing. Now there were no imperial edicts againſt the <hi>Christians,</hi> as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in the time of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> as appears by <hi>Gallio</hi>'s words, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.14, 15. and by <hi>Pauls</hi> appeal to <hi>Caeſar, Act.</hi> 25.11. and by <hi>Act.</hi> 28.31. but in <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitians</hi> time there were edicts made againſt them, and 'tis the more likely that <hi>Iohn</hi> was baniſhed then, and the ſcope of the <hi>Revelation</hi> is not to acquaint the Churches with the deſtruction of the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> but to acquaint them rather with the things that are, and the things that ſhall be

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is paſt my underſtanding to find a reaſon why we ſhould begin the account of the <hi>eight Kings or Emperors, c.</hi> 17.10. from <hi>Claudius</hi> and end it in <hi>Domitian,</hi> and ſo leave out all the <hi>Emperors</hi> that were before <hi>Claudius,</hi> and all them that went behind <hi>Domitian,</hi> for the ten firſt perſecutions did not begin in <hi>Claudius,</hi> but in <hi>Nero,</hi> neither did they end in <hi>Domitian,</hi> but in <hi>Diocleſian, Maximian, Galerius,</hi> and <hi>Licinius,</hi> neither did any remarkable thing happen in the days of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and end in the days of <hi>Domitian,</hi> ſo as to force us to begin the account in the one, and end it in the other. 2. It cannot be made intelligible how the Angel could ſay to <hi>Iohn</hi> at the <hi>Revelation</hi> of theſe Viſions, <hi>Five are fallen,</hi> meaning thereby <hi>Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho,</hi> and <hi>Vitellius,</hi> if ſo be theſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:180584:16"/>were revealed to <hi>John</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Claudius,</hi> for theſe <hi>five were not fallen</hi> then, but <hi>Nero, Galba, Otho,</hi> and <hi>Vitellius</hi> did ſucceed him in the Throne, and were not fallen while he lived. 3. It is paſt my intelligence to make it good, that theſe Viſions were received by <hi>John</hi> in the time of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> and not committed to writing till the time of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> who began his Reign fifteen years after <hi>Claudius</hi>'s deceaſe, for <hi>John</hi> did write his Viſions preſently, as ſoon as he received them, as appears <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.4. and was commanded ſo to do, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.10. 4. It is paſt my capacity to conceive that all the Prophecies in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> from the beginning of the ſixth Chapter, to the end of the ninth, beſides ſome of them that follow after, were fulfilled before the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Veſpaſian;</hi> and yet to think (as they do) that they were committed to writing in the time of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> for then the <hi>Revelation</hi> ſhould be written, and ſent to the Churches, after moſt of the Prophecies were paſt. Laſtly, It cannot be made intelligible unto me, that <hi>John</hi> ſhould commit theſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to writing in the time of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> and yet ſee the name of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> (as they ſay he did) in the time of <hi>Domitian,</hi> for then he ſhould write theſe Viſions before ſome of them were revealed.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> If any one will ſay, that <hi>John</hi> received the <hi>Revelation</hi> not all together at one time, but at ſeveral diſtant times, as the Prophet <hi>Eſai</hi> did his Viſions, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1.1. Let me requeſt him to tell us what Viſions <hi>John</hi> received at one time, and what Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions at another time, for unleſs he can and will do that, why ſhould any one believe him?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If any one ſuppoſe that <hi>John</hi> received ſome Viſions in the time of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and did defer the writing of them till the time of <hi>Domitian</hi> or <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> when he received more Viſions,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:180584:17"/>this were to do the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> injury, who was to write his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions preſently, and ſend them to the Churches preſently, and not defer them till a long time after, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.10. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.4. He was about to write preſently what the ſeven thunders had ſpoken, and had ſo done, if he had not been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to conceal it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If any one ſhall think, that <hi>John</hi> received ſome Viſions in the Reign of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and did write them then, and that he received other Viſions in the time of <hi>Domitian</hi> or <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> and did write them then; this were to make two Books of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and one of them is ſuppoſed to be written in the time of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and the other in the time of <hi>Domitian</hi> or <hi>Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. If any man imagine, that <hi>John</hi> received the Viſion of the ſeven Churches firſt, and did write it preſently, and ſend it to the Churches by it ſelf, and that afterward he received more Viſions at ſeveral times, and did write them at ſeveral diſtant times as he did receive them, this were to make two or more Books of the <hi>Revelation</hi> as was ſaid before. And if it be ſaid, that when he had received all, he did write the firſt Viſions over again, and add the latter to them, and put them into one volume, this were to make the Apoſtle do things over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and write ſome of his Viſions twice, and ſend them to the Churches twice, which we cannot find that any of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did. Beſides, this is a meer imagination, and every thing they ſay in this point is but meer imagination and no more: but let them imagine what they will, I prove it was not ſo by this Argument. If <hi>John</hi> were commanded at the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of his Viſions, to write his Viſions all together, and ſend them to the Churches all together, then he did not write the firſt Viſion by it ſelf, and ſend it to the Churches by it ſelf, without the reſt: but <hi>John</hi> was commanded at the firſt entrance of his Viſions, to write his Viſions all together, and ſend them
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:180584:17"/>to the Churches all together: therefore he did not write the firſt Viſion by it ſelf, and ſend it to the Churches by it ſelf without the reſt. The minor is proved, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.19. <hi>VVrite the things which thou haſt ſeen, and the things which are, and the things which ſhall be hereafter:</hi> where by <hi>the things which he had ſeen,</hi> is meant, the Viſion of the ſeven <hi>Golden Candleſticks,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the firſt Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. by the <hi>things which are,</hi> is meant, the things which Chriſt ſhould reveal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, concerning the preſent ſtate of the ſeven Churches, and they are ſpoken of in the ſecond and third chapters, with which ſome prophecies concerning the future ſtate of the ſeven Churches are mixt; and by the <hi>things which ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,</hi> is meant, the Prophecies from the fourth Chapter to the end of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> Now had he ſaid at this time, which was the firſt entrance of his Viſions, <hi>VVrite the things which thou haſt ſeen,</hi> and <hi>the things which are,</hi> and no more, he might have written the three firſt chapters by themſelves without the other: but in regard he ſaith at this time, which was the firſt entrance of his Viſions, <hi>VVrite the things which thou haſt ſeen, and the things which are, and the things which ſhall be hereafter,</hi> he might not write any one of them by themſelves, but he was to write them all together, and ſend them to the Churches all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If <hi>John</hi> received his Viſions at ſeveral diſtant times, as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> did his, it is likely he would have told us of it, as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> doth, who <hi>c.</hi> 7.1. tells us that the Viſion which he then ſaw, was in the firſt year of <hi>Belſhaſar,</hi> and <hi>c.</hi> 8.1. he tells us that the Viſion which he then ſaw, was in the third year of <hi>Belſhaſar;</hi> and 'tis likely, that if <hi>Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="6">6. There be many differences between the Viſions of the Prophet <hi>Eſai,</hi> and the Viſions of the Apoſtolical Prophet <hi>John;</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:180584:18"/>as, The Prophet <hi>Eſai</hi> ſaith expreſly, that his Viſions were in the days of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah, Jotham, Ahaz,</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> Kings of <hi>Juda, Eſa.</hi> 1.1. but <hi>John</hi> makes no mention of any other day that he received his Viſions, than on the Lords day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. 2. The Viſions as well of <hi>Eſai</hi> as of <hi>John,</hi> were when both of them were in a trance; but herein they differ, that the trances of <hi>Eſai</hi> were at diſtant times, ſome in one Kings Reign, and ſome in another Kings Reign, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſſeth, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1.1. but the trances of <hi>John</hi> were all of them upon the Lords day, and upon no other, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. 3. The Viſions which the Prophet <hi>Eſai</hi> ſaw concerning <hi>Iuda,</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> were ſo many Sermons which he Preached to the people at ſeveral times, far diſtant one from other, and they were ſo many, and ſo long, that he could not preach them all in one day, therefore of neceſſity there was an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion between his preaching of one Sermon, and the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of another: but the Viſions of the Apoſtolical Prophet <hi>Iohn</hi> were not preached <hi>Sermons,</hi> but mental <hi>Revelations</hi> which he was to write, and ſend unto the Churches all at once, and they were not ſo many, nor ſo long, but they could be ſeen, and be written by him too, all in one day. 4. The writings of the Prophet <hi>Eſai,</hi> be but the heads of the Sermons which he preached, the Sermons for the words were a great deal lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the Apoſtolical Prophet <hi>Iohn,</hi> is the full ſubſtance of what he ſaw and heard, without dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of the words. 5. The Prophet <hi>Eſai</hi> was at liberty to go and preach unto the people, Sermon after Sermon; but the Apoſtolical Prophet <hi>Iohn</hi> was not at liberty to travel to the Churches, and Preach one day to the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and another day to the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and other days to the other Churches, as he muſt have done, had he preached the <hi>Revelation</hi> to them, the places being far diſtant one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, therefore he was neceſſitated to write his <hi>Revelation</hi> to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:180584:18"/>the Churches, and ſend it all together, and his Commiſſion was ſo to do, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.11.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. There was not any conſiderable intermiſſion between one Viſion and another, excepting onely at the opening of the ſeventh ſeal, where there was an intermiſſion (not of <hi>Iohns</hi> ecſtaſie, for he was in the Spirit all that while, but an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion) of farther <hi>Revelations</hi> for the ſpace of half an hour, and no longer, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.1. but between the other Viſions there was not ſuch an intermiſſion, but as ſoon as one was paſt, the other came immediately without any conſiderable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion, as you may read <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.14.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The Book ſealed with ſeven ſeals, was revealed all at once, and not at ſeveral times far diſtant one from other, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.1. now that Book contained in it all the Prophecies in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> as ſhall be proved when we come unto the tenth chapter.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> If all the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> be of a ſhort continuance, God hath left his Church without a Prophecy to the end of the World, for there is no Prophecy which doth reach ſo far, except <hi>Daniel</hi> or the <hi>Revelation,</hi> but they ſay the Prophecies of <hi>Daniel</hi> ended with the deſtruction of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and if the <hi>Revelation</hi> ends then too, or a little
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:180584:20"/>after, where have we a Prophecy to the end of the World?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We have a Prophecy in the fifth ſeal, which begins with <hi>How long Lord, Holy and true, Rev.</hi> 6:10. therefore 'tis a long time before that Prophecy of the fifth ſeal is to begin, and conſequently it is a long time before the Prophecies of the four firſt Seals ſhall have an end.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We have in the twentieth chapter, a Prophecy of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years long; now a thouſand years are not of a ſhort, but of a long continuance.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. We have in that twentieth chapter, a Prophecy of the laſt Judgment it ſelf, and a large deſcription of it, from the eleventh verſe, to the end of the chapter, therefore the <hi>Revelation</hi> is a Prophecy reaching not only to the laſt Judgment, but takes the laſt Judgment in to boot.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We may go a little further, and ſay, that in the one and twentieth, and two and twentieth chapters, we have a Prophecy of the new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the eternal City of the bleſſed, and of the <hi>Lake of fire,</hi> burning with Brimſtone, the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing habitation of the damned; therefore the <hi>Revelation</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not only to the laſt Judgment incluſively, but goes beyond it, and ſpeaks in general of what ſhall come to paſs after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> were of ſhort continuance, what is the reaſon that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not come to Judgment all this while? is it not becauſe the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> which goe before it, are not yet fulfilled? for if
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:180584:21"/>they were, <hi>Chriſt</hi> would come to Judgment preſently, and not defer his coming a moment longer; and if <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould come to Judgment to morrow, the Prophecies of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which go before it, would be fulfilled before to morrow; and if <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould defer his coming until another year, or until another age be over, it is becauſe the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> which go before his coming will not be fulfilled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. I will not take upon me to determine when the day of Judgment ſhall begin, but my opinion is, 'tis farther off than many men ſuppoſe, it may be ſix thouſand years from the Creation of the World ſhall be expired firſt, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth thouſand ſhall be the day of Judgment; and he that lives two hundred, or three hundred years hence, and finds that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not then come to Judgment, let him know the reaſon is, becauſe the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> which go before that day, are not then fulfilled, and that <hi>Chriſt</hi> will defer his coming till they be: And as when he ſuffered on the Croſs, he remained alive upon the Croſs till all things were fulfilled, and then gave up the Ghoſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.28.30. ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> will not come to Judgment, but abide in Heaven, where he is, until the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> be fulfilled which go before that day; and as ſoon as that is done, then <hi>Chriſt</hi> will come to Judgment and not defer it any longer, as we may read, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.21. And if it ſhall be asked of me what Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> be yet behind, and unfulfilled?

                  <p n="5">5. Let us take a view of the ſeveral Seals in order, and we ſhall find that not any one of them was fulfilled in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> at or before the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> by <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> as ſome would make us believe they were.</p>
                  <p>Begin we with the firſt Seal, which is a Prophecy of a <hi>white Horſe, and he that ſate thereon, had a Bow, and a Crown was given unto him, and he went forth conquering, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,</hi> but no ſuch thing was fulfilled in <hi>Judaea,</hi> at or before the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in a literal ſenſe, which is the cauſe they fly unto a myſtical, and underſtand the Prophecy of the conqueſt of the Goſpel: but it will not ſerve their turn, for the Scene of the Goſpel is the World, and not the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row confines of <hi>Judaea,</hi> from whence it was removed before this Prophecy was revealed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.43. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.46. To which may be added, that the firſt Seal ends before the ſecond Seal begins, but the Goſpel ſhall continue to the Worlds end.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Seal, is a Prophecy of a <hi>red Horſe, and power was given to him that ſat thereon, to take peace from the earth, and that they ſhould kill one another, and there was given unto him a great Sword,</hi> but when was this Tragedy acted in <hi>Judaea?</hi> The inteſtine ſlaughters of <hi>Jews</hi> among themſelves will not amount unto a War, and if they would, yet they were not ſuch noted ones, nor ſo numerous as theſe ſhall be, to which
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:180584:23"/>may be added, that the rider on this Red Horſe was to take peace from the <hi>earth,</hi> which word is too large to be confined to the narrow compaſs of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where the <hi>Zelots</hi> ſlew their Brethren, not on Horſe-back, but on Foot, and the <hi>Sicarii</hi> had not great Swords as this Rider had, but ſhort Pocket Daggers to ſlay men with, a weapon fitter for Thieves and Robbers, than ſuch noted Warriers as this Prophecy aimeth at.</p>
                  <p>The third Seal, is a Prophecy of a <hi>Black Horſe, and he that ſate on him, had a pair of balances in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midſt of the four Beaſts ſay, A meaſure of Wheat for a penny, and three meaſures of Barley for a penny,</hi> &amp;c. which words are either meant of Famine, or of civil Juſtice; but the broiles, and tumults in <hi>Judaea</hi> would not ſuffer civil Juſtice to be uſed. And if we underſtand this Prophecy of Famine, where ſhall we find a noted Famine in <hi>Judaea?</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that which <hi>Agabus</hi> ſpake of, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.28. or that which happened in the City, in the time of the Siege: but neither of theſe can be meant in this place; not the firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the adequate Scene of that Famine was not <hi>Judaea</hi> but the World, and the time when it happened, was in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> which was before <hi>Iohns</hi> baniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Patmos</hi> as themſelves confeſs; and not the ſecond, for the like reaſon, becauſe it came to paſs at the Siege of the City, by <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> which was before the Prophecy was revealed to <hi>Iohn,</hi> which was in the Reign of <hi>Domitian.</hi> To which may be added, that this third Seal begins when the ſecond Seal doth end, but the ſlaughters which the <hi>Zelots</hi> committed in the City, were not ended when the Famine did begin, but the Famine was the occaſion that they ſlew the people which denied them bread. Add we further that a <hi>Chaenix</hi> was no <hi>Iewiſh</hi> meaſure, and therefore the Prophecy was not fulfilled in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in the time of the Siege, but is to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:180584:24"/>be ſought for in thoſe places where a <hi>Choenix</hi> is uſed.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Seal, is a Prophecy of a <hi>pale Horſe, and his name that ſat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him, and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with Sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the Beaſts of the earth,</hi> but when was this Prophecy fulfilled in <hi>Judaea?</hi> for either this Seal is the ſame for ſubſtance with the two former, or a diſtinct Seal from them both. If they ſay it is the ſame for ſubſtance with the two former, then ſeeing the two former were not fulfilled in <hi>Judaea,</hi> this Seal was not fulfilled there neither, and if it be ſo, that this Seal is the ſame with the two former, then there are but ſix Seals in all, and not ſeven. But if they ſay that this Seal is diſtinct from the two former, then beſides the great Sword mentioned in the ſecond Seal, they muſt find out another Sword for this Seal, and beſides the Famine which they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is meant in the third Seal, they muſt find out another Famine for this Seal which as yet they have not done. To which may be added, that the Scene of this Prophecy is the fourth part of the <hi>earth,</hi> and therefore not <hi>Iudaea</hi> which is but a corner of the earth, much leſs the tetrarchy of <hi>Galilee,</hi> which is leſs than the former; for though the Sword was in <hi>Galilee,</hi> and the War began there, yet when was there a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino in <hi>Galilee?</hi> when was there a Peſtilence in <hi>Galilee?</hi> and when were men ſlain with wild Beaſts in <hi>Galilee,</hi> or in any other Region of <hi>Iudaea?</hi> Doth not <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſay, that when the City was taken, the handſomeſt were reſerved for triumph, the reſt that were above ſeventeen years of age were ſent bound to <hi>Egypt,</hi> to be Slaves there, others diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed in the Provinces to be torn aſunder by wild Beaſts, ſo that the Scene where this was done is not <hi>Iudaea,</hi> but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces afar off.</p>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:180584:24"/>of them that were ſlain for the word of God, and for the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which they held,</hi> &amp;c <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10, 11. but where ſhall we find any Martyrs in <hi>Judaea</hi> before the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> except <hi>Stephen,</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> the Brother of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Lord. and thoſe that were ſlain by <hi>Paul</hi> before his Converſion, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.21. <hi>Act.</hi> 22.4. <hi>Act.</hi> 26.10. but all theſe are too few to make up ſuch a number of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs as the Prophecy aimeth at, for they were without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.9. Beſides, the Prophecy ſpeaks of two ranks of Martyrs, firſt the ſouls under the Altar that cried to God for vengeance; ſecondly their fellow Servants, and their Brethren upon earth, that ſhould be killed as they were: now if theſe men can find theſe Martyrs in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> before the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and tell me who the firſt and ſecond ranks were, I will hearken to them. The multitude of theſe Martyrs plainly ſhews, that they were not all ſlain before the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and the words which they uſed in their cry, <hi>How long Lord, Holy and true,</hi> do alſo ſhew that it is a long time before they make their cry, and longer than that before their fellow Servants, and their Brethren ſuffer as they did, and longer than both before the vengeance which they cry for comes to paſs, Ler men conſider what they ſay, doth the Prophecy ſpeak only of the Martyrs which were ſlain in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> before the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem?</hi> then it ſpeaks but of three Martyrs, beſides thoſe which were ſlain by <hi>Paul,</hi> and no more: but if they ſay that others be included which were ſlain in other places, then the adequate Scene of the Prophecy is not <hi>Iudaea</hi> but the World: but take we all the Martyrs that were ſlain in the World, before the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and the number is too few, and the time too ſhort to include all the Martyrs which the Prophecy ſpeaketh of.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth Seal, is a Prophecy of Eclipſes of the Sun, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:180584:25"/>Moon, for <hi>the Sun became black as ſackcloath of hair, and the Moon became as blood, v.</hi> 12. but there was but one Eclipſe of the Moon, between <hi>Goriſts</hi> Aſcenſion, and the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that was in the ſixth year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> which was before the Prophecy was revealed, for they ſay themſelves it was not revealed till the ninth year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and we ſay it was not revealed till the fourteenth year of <hi>Domitian;</hi> but take which of theſe you will, it comes all to one effect as to this matter, for the Eclipſe was in the ſixth year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and ſo before the Prophecy was revealed, which way ſoever we take, and there were but two Eclipſes of the Sun, whereof the firſt was in the fifth year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> before the Prophecy was revealed by their own confeſſion, the other was in the ſixth year of <hi>Nero,</hi> which was more viſible at <hi>Rome</hi> than at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where the Stats were ſeen at the time of the Eclipſe, and the Eclipſe it ſelf was ſeen in the midſt of their Sacrifices, which the <hi>Senate</hi> cauſed to be made for the death of <hi>Agrippina</hi> who was ſlain by her Son <hi>Nero;</hi> ſo that if it portended any thing at all, it was rather againſt <hi>Rome</hi> than <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> But every one of theſe Eclipſes were but natural, ſuch as come to paſs now a days every year by the natural courſe of the Sun and Moon, and Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers can Prognoſticate of them before hand: but it is more likely that the Eclipſes which the Prophecy ſpeaks of be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, ſuch as that was at our Saviours paſſion, where the Sun was Eclipſed, the Moon being at the full, when as a natural Eclipſe doth always happen at the change of the Moon. It follows in the text, <hi>And the Stars of Heaven fell unto the earth, even as a Fig Tree caſteth her untimely Figs when ſhe is ſhaken of a mighty wind,</hi> but if this were done in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> at or before the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> who took up theſe Stars, and ſhewed them to <hi>Veſpaſian?</hi> They cannot ſay that theſe Stars are <hi>myſtically</hi> to be underſtood, for they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:180584:25"/>underſtand them literally of meteors: but that there did ſuch meteors fall from Heaven upon <hi>Judaea,</hi> and in ſuch a Multitude as the Text ſpeaks of, either at or before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> Hiſtory is too lame to bring us tidings of it. <hi>And the Kings of the earth hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> but there were no Kings in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at the time of the Siege, <hi>and the great men, and the rich men, and the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the free-men</hi> that were in it at that time hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, not for fear of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his wrath, as the men whom the Prophecy ſpeaks of ſhall, but for fear of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and his Army. The concluſion therefore is, that this Prophecy was not fulfilled in <hi>Judaea,</hi> either at or before the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> but is yet to be expected.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Queſt. <hi>Whether the firſt Seal be a Prophecy of the Preaching, and prevailing of the Goſpel?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. No good reaſon can be given for ſuch an expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Goſpel was preached in all the world for a witneſs to all Nations, and prevailed very much among them before this Prophecy was revealed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.14. <hi>Mark</hi> 13.10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is nothing in the Prophecy which is an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem or ſymbol of the Goſpel, but of War and Victory very fitly.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By this reckoning this Seal ſhall never have an end, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Church on earth hath an end, for the Goſpel, and the preaching of it ſhall continue unto the Worlds end, and the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. By the Lamb which opened the firſt Seal, is meant <hi>Chriſt;</hi> therefore by the Rider on the white Horſe is meant ſome other perſon. Chriſt was the revealer, and he that ſate upon the white Horſe, is the perſon revealed, the executioner of the Prophecy.</p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:180584:26"/>
                  <p n="6">6. Chriſts Crown was given unto him before this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was revealed to <hi>John,</hi> but this Rider on the white Horſe who ever he be, was to receive his Crown after ward by virtue of this Prophecy.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. What Chriſt doth undertake, he doth bring to paſs, and not deſiſt before the work be finiſhed, but this Rider who ever he be, <hi>went forth conquering, and to conquer,</hi> that is, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer ſome, and had a mind to conquer more, but did not finiſh the work.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Chriſt did threaten the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> to take the Goſpel from them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5. therefore he doth not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy in this Seal, that the Goſpel ſhould continue and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail among them, the event doth ſhew the contrary at this day, for the Goſpel is removed from thence, and from all the ſeven Churches to whom this Prophecy was ſent.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Queſt. <hi>VVhether the third Seal be a Prophecy of Famine, or of civil juſtice?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Famine is Prophecied of in the next Seal, therefore not in this.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Balances are not an emblem or ſymbol of Famine, but of civil Juſtice rather.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To eat bread by weight is a ſign of Famine, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4.16. but if a meaſure of the fineſt grain be to be bought for a penny, and of courſer three meaſures, men ſhould not be afraid of ſuch a Famine, ſaith Dr. <hi>Mayer</hi> p. 316, 317.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A meaſure of fine flour for a Shekel, and two meaſures of Barley for a Shekei was a Prophecy of plenty in the Gates of <hi>Samaria,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7.1. Why may not a meaſure of Wheat for a penny, and three meaſures of Barley for a penny be a Prophecy of plenty too, or at leaſt of ſufficiency if not of plenty? It is certain that a Shekel was much bigger than a penny, for a penny was but ſeven pence half penny of our money, but a Shekel was fifteen pence at leaſt: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p n="5">5. The word <hi>Choenix</hi> which we tranſlate meaſure, was as well a great meaſure as a ſmall. Now they which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this Prophecy of Famine, ſay that <hi>Choenix</hi> was a ſmall meaſure, and did contain ſo much Wheat as would ſuffice a man for one day and no more, and they ſay a penny was as much money as a man could earn in one day, and no more.

                  <p n="6">6. Suppoſe <hi>Choenix</hi> be a ſmall meaſure and to contain a quart as ſome would have it, and no more, yet here is no great Famine for all that, as was in <hi>Jacobs</hi> time, when there was no Corn to be had for money in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but they were forced to travel into <hi>Egypt</hi> to buy them Corn, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.2. Here be alſo three meaſures of Barley for a penny, and that would ſerve a man three days, and here be three meaſures of Barley for another penny, and that would ſerve a man three days more, and if he had a mind to eat wheaten bread there were four days more in the week, wherein he might la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to provide him wheat and other commodities which he wanted.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Queſt. <hi>VVhether the Prophecy of the ſixth Seal be literally to be underſtood?</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p n="5">5. Queſt. <hi>VVhen theſe Seals were to begin, and when to have an end? or whether they be already paſt, or yet to be expected?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It is ſaid in the beginning of the fifth Seal. <hi>How long Lord, Holy and true,</hi> therefore 'tis a long time ere the fifth Seal is to begin, and conſequently it is a long time before the four firſt Seals have an end.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is ſaid in the cloſe of that Seal, that they <hi>ſhould reſt yet for a little ſeaſon, until their fellow Servants, and their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren which ſhould be killed as they were, ſhould be fulfilled,</hi> therefore that Seal is to continue but a little ſeaſon after the cry of the ſouls is over, and conſequently the ſeven Trumpets which contain Gods Judgments on their perſecutors are to come ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſixth Seal is a Prophecy of the ſignes which Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticate the day of Judgment, and the ſecond coming of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be near at hand, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.30. <hi>Mark</hi> 13.26. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.27, 28.

                  <p n="4">4. From the coming of thoſe ſigns unto the day of Judgment is but a ſhort time, as our Saviour alſo ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.33. therefore all the Prophecies in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> from the ſixth Seal, to the nineteenth chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 11. where the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth commence, are to continue but a ſhort time, and conſequently it is a long time before the four firſt Seals do end, and for ought we know, it is a long time before any of them ſhall begin.</p>

And I ſaid, Ah Sir, thou knoweſt who they are, and I would learn of thee who they be, and from whence they came to that bleſſed State, and tranſcendent degree of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which I ſee them in at this time, and what it was that brought them hither. Then he ſaid unto me, Theſe be the Holy Martyrs of the Church which were in great affliction in the World, and ſuffered death for the cauſe of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſhed their blood for profeſſing of his Goſpel, for this cauſe it is that they be now in white robes of Glory which were made ſo by his blood, and are given them as a reward for their ſuffering for him.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. For this cauſe it is that they be now before the Throne of God, and ſerve him in the Church Triumphant, as in their life-time they did in the Church Militant, and God ſhall dwell with them, and be their God.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. They ſuffered hunger heretofore, but now they ſuffer it no more, they ſuffered thirſt heretofore, but now they ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it no more, they ſuffered perſecution heretofore, but they ſhall ſuffer it no more.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. For Jeſus Chriſt ſhall feed them with his Heavenly Food, and give them drink of his Heavenly Well, and God ſhall wipe all tears from off their eyes, ſo that no ſorrow ſhall come near them.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. If by the tribes of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> be not meant the <hi>Jews</hi> only, how ſhall we know when they are only ſpoken of in Scripture? and when not? or whether they be onely ſpoken of by that name at all?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I find that the word <hi>Iſrael</hi> is ſometimes put for <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 32.28. ſometimes for the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews, Exod.</hi> 5.2. ſometimes for the ten tribes only, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.15. ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the Godly People of that Nation, and no more, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. But if any one can find, that by that word is meant the Godly <hi>Gentiles</hi> only, or the Church of God in general conſiſting both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> let him cite the place, and prove it ſo to be, and I will be of his mind.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The tribe of <hi>Juda</hi> is not the tribe of <hi>Reuben,</hi> nor the tribe of <hi>Reuben,</hi> the tribe of <hi>Gad,</hi> &amp;c. and if by theſe words we underſtand the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> what Nation ſhall we underſtand by the tribe of <hi>Juda?</hi> what Nation by the tribe of <hi>Reuben?</hi> and what Nation by the tribe of <hi>Gad?</hi> and ſo of all the reſt. And if it be ſaid, That by the tribe of <hi>Juda,</hi> is meant the tribe that doth confeſs God, and by the tribe of <hi>Reuben,</hi> the tribe that doth behold the Son, and by the tribe of <hi>Gad</hi> and <hi>Aſer</hi> a bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed company, what is this but to turn the proper names of men into appellatives, and to confound the tribes one with another? and make no diſtinction at all between them? For
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:180584:30"/>
                     <hi>Reuben</hi> doth confeſs God as well as <hi>Juda,</hi> and <hi>Juda</hi> doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Son by Faith as well as <hi>Reuben,</hi> and both of them are a bleſſed company. Yea, it were to make but one tribe of all the twelve, for all the twelve tribes do confeſs God, and behold the Son by Faith, and all the twelve tribes are a bleſſed company, and not one or two only. And if we ſhould tranſlate the Hebrew proper names of men, and put them into appellative, as the firſt of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and the third of <hi>Luke,</hi> and as ſome would have it the nine firſt Chapters of the firſt Book of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> we ſhall make mad tranſlation of the Bible, and meer nonſence of the Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. If by the tribes of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> be meant the Church in general, then by the tribe of <hi>Juda,</hi> is meant ſome Church or other in particular; and if ſo, then let me requeſt them to tell me what that Church is? what Church is meant by the tribe of <hi>Juda?</hi> what Church by the tribe of <hi>Reuben?</hi> and what Church by the tribe of <hi>Gad?</hi> and ſo of all the reſt. But to theſe queſtions they have hitherto held their peace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Queſt. <hi>Whether the definite number of the Sealed be definitely to be underſtood?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If the definite number of the ſealed be put for an indefinite, how ſhall we know when ſuch a number is definitely to be underſtood? and when not?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A whole number, ſuch as 10.20.30.40. and the like, may be taken indefinitely, and is ſo taken in this Book, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. but a broken number, ſuch as 120.130.140. and the like, are never ſo taken. Now the number of the ſealed is a broken number 144000, and ſo is 42 a broken number, and 1260 a broken number, and ſuch numbers are never taken indefinitely. See Annotations of certain Learned Divines, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Where a number is oppoſed to an indefinite, it is defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:180584:30"/>to he underſtood; but the number of the ſealed is oppoſed to an indefinite, <hi>v.</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Where a number is exactly told, and total'd it is definite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be underſtood: now the number of the ſealed is exactly told, and total'd, and when he ſaith, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>I heard the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them which were ſealed,</hi> his meaning is, he heard the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal number of them, after they were told, and the total num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was 144000, neither more nor leſs: and when afterward he ſaith, <hi>I beheld, and ſo a great multitude which no man could number,</hi> his meaning is, they were not told, and ſummed up as the former were, and therefore he could not ſet down the juſt number of them, as he had done of the other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Queſt. <hi>Whether all the</hi> Jews <hi>were ſealed, or but ſome on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The number of the ſealed were one hundred fourty and four thouſand, and no more; but if all the <hi>Jews</hi> were told, and total'd, they would far exceed that number, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.10.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There be as many ſealed of one tribe as of another, but it is not likely, that at the execution of the Prophecy, there ſhall be no more perſon, living of one tribe than of another. We read <hi>Numb.</hi> 1.21.23.25. that when the tribes were numbred, the Children of <hi>Simeon</hi> were more than the Children of <hi>Reuben,</hi> and the Children of <hi>Reuben</hi> were more than the Children of <hi>Gad</hi> at that time, and ſo of other tribes there ſpoken of ſome were more than others; and ſo of every tribe that ſhall be ſealed at the execution of this Prophecy, it is likely, that ſome tribes have more than others living upon earth, and not that every tribe hath juſt twelve thouſand perſons living at the time of ſealing, and no more.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All the <hi>Jews</hi> cannot be ſealed becauſe the whole tribe of <hi>Dan</hi> is left out, and not any one of them ſealed.</p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:180584:31"/>
                  <p n="4">4. It is likely that in the oppoſite number to the ſealed, there be ſome <hi>Jews</hi> among them, and that they likewiſe are included under <hi>all Nations, and Kindreds, and People, and Tongues</hi> mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 9. and not the <hi>Gentiles</hi> only.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If all the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be ſealed at this time, then from the time of this ſealing none of them could ſuffer Martyrdom; but we find afterward that many of them ſuffer Martyrdom for the Faith of <hi>Chriſt</hi> under the Beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.7.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The firſt Fruits are leſs than all; but theſe ſealed ones are the firſt Fruits and no more, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It may well be thought that theſe ſealed ones be men, and not women, and that for theſe reaſons. 1. Becauſe it is not uſual in Scripture, to count the number of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but of men only: thus when they went into <hi>Egypt</hi> the men are counted, and not the women, <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.8, 9, &amp;c. and again when they came forth of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the men were counted, and not the women, <hi>Numb.</hi> 1, 2.20, 21. &amp;c. and ſo the like in other places, the males are counted, and not the Females, <hi>Ezra</hi> 2.2, 3, &amp;c. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 7.7, 8, 9, &amp;c. and therefore theſe that are counted here, be only Males, and not Females. 2. The firſt Fruits that were dedicated to God of men, and of Beaſts, were the Males only, and we may not think that the firſt Fruits were only of vegetables, for then theſe ſealed ones could not be firſt Fruits, as they are ſaid to be, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4. but the firſt born of men and Beaſts were firſt Fruits as well as vegetables, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.29, 30. and ſuch were males only, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.19, 20. <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.2.12.15. Now theſe ſealed ones are called the firſt Fruits to God, and to the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4. not in reſpect of ſanctification, as all believers are, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.18. but by peculiar dedication to God, and to the Lamb, as the firſt born were, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be Males only. 3. Becauſe theſe are ſaid to be
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:180584:31"/>redeemed from among men, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4. Now what redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption is this? not the common redemption, by the blood of Chriſt from ſin, and condemnation which belongs to all the elect in general, but the peculiar redemption of the firſt born which belongs to the Males only, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.2.12.13.15. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.19, 20. Laſtly, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4. Theſe are they which were not defiled with Women, and therefore they be men, and not women; and what kind of defilement doth he mean? not a ſpiritual defilement with <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols;</hi> which is as much as to ſay, that theſe men be not <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,</hi> nor yet a carnal defilement with <hi>Harlots,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, that theſe men be not <hi>Adulterers:</hi> but a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial defilement with <hi>VVives,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, that theſe men be <hi>Virgins,</hi> and unmarried perſons, and had not known a woman, of which kind of defilement ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.15. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.4, 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Queſt. <hi>VVhat kind of Seal is meant in this place? whether the Seal of Sanctification, or of corporal preſervation?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The ſeal of ſanctification is not committed to the Angels, but to the Spirit of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. but the ſeal here ſpoken of, is committed to the Angels, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſeal of ſanctification is chiefly inward in the heart; but this here ſpoken of, is only outward in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, <hi>v.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are called the Servants of God before that they be ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>v.</hi> 3. and therefore they are ſanctified before this ſeal is given unto them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The ſeal of ſanctification is a common ſeal, and doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to all believers; but this is peculiar to the perſons here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The ſeal of ſanctification doth not exempt from bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily danger, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.7. But this is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given them, that their bodies might not be hurt,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:180584:32"/>
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.4. ſee the like <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4, 5, 6. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.15.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The ſeal of ſanctification is given ſucceſſively in all ages of the World; but theſe are ſealed all at once in one day.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The ſeal of ſanctification is given by degrees to ſome more, to others leſs; but theſe are all ſealed alike, one as far forth as another.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The ſeal of ſanctification doth admit degrees after it is given, and a man is ſanctified more at one time than another, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. but theſe were ſealed as much at one time as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: and as the mark which <hi>Cain</hi> had, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.15. and which the men in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> had, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4. did not diminiſh or increaſe, ſo the ſeal which theſe men had, continued in the ſame condition all their life afterward.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Queſt. <hi>VVhether the great multitude mentioned</hi> v. 9. <hi>were ſealed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It is not ſaid that they were ſealed, and therefore we may not think they were, unleſs we have ſome reaſon for it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are a diſtinct company from the ſealed, <hi>v.</hi> 4.9.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are more in number than the ſealed, and therefore they could not all be ſealed, for the number of the ſealed is but finite, one hundred fourty and four thouſand, and no more; but this great multitude were ſo many that no mortal man could number them, <hi>v.</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Iohn</hi> knew the ſealed who they were, and what their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was, <hi>v.</hi> 4. but he knew not theſe who they were, nor the number of them, <hi>v.</hi> 9.14.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The ſealed were preſerved from deſtruction, and the ſeal was therefore given, that they might be ſecured, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.4. But <hi>theſe are they which came out of great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, and have waſhed their robes, and made them white in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:180584:32"/>the blood of the Lamb v.</hi> 14. and therefore theſe be Martyrs, but the others are not.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The ſealed be the men which are to live in the time of the ſeven Trumpets, but are not to ſuffer under them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.3, 4. but theſe latter be the men which ſhall ſuffer for the Faith of Chriſt before the Trumpets ſhall begin; and the reaſon why they are introduced in this place, is not to ſhew the time or cauſes of their ſufferings, but to ſhew the bliſsful ſtate, and happineſs which they have in Heaven at this very time, when the other, ſhall be ſealed upon earth.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The ſealed be the men which are to get the Victory over the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and over his mark, and over the number of his name, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.2, 3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.2, 3. but theſe latter be the men which ſhall die for the Faith of Chriſt before the <hi>Beaſt</hi> begins his Reign, and ſhall be then in Heaven, in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveable bliſs and happineſs, when the other ſhall be ſealed upon earth.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The ſealed be ſome eminent members of the Church Militant, which ſhall be in jeopardy of their lives in the time of the enſuing Prophecies, but are therefore ſealed that they might be preſerved from ſuffering in the time of thoſe dangers: the latter be ſome eminent members of the Church Triumphant, which ſuffered while they lived, but when the ſealed ones are ſealed, they ſhall be in Heaven ſecured from ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering any more.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. ANd when he had opened the ſeventh Seal, it did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately appear what the Prophecy of that Seal ſhould be, there came nothing forth of that Roll as there did out of the other Rolls to ſhew the Prophecy thereof, whereupon there was ſilence in Heaven for the ſpace of half an hour, every one expecting what would happen, and ſhew the Prophecy of this ſeventh Seal.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And after the ſpace of half an hour, I ſaw there were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the ſeven mighty Angels which ſtood before the Throne of God, ſeven Trumpets, whereby I underſtood, that theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Trumpets contain the Prophecy of the ſeventh Seal.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And when they had received their Trumpets, another Angel came and ſtood at the Altar, where the Souls were that prayed to God for Vengeance of their bloud, with a Golden Cenſer in his hand, and much ſweet Incenſe in it, that he might add it to the prayers of the Saints which were under the Altar; that as they prayed for Vengeance of their bloud, before their fellow Servants and their Brethren were ſlain, ſo now they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlain, take up the ſame Requeſt again, and their fellow Servants and their Brethren joyn with them therein, and the Angel offers Incenſe upon the Altar at the ſame time.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And the Incenſe which the Angel offered was added to the prayers of the Saints, ſo that the prayers of the Saints which were under the Altar did not aſcend alone, but the ſmoke of the Incenſe which the Angels offered, aſcended with
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:180584:33"/>them, and both of them made a ſweet perfume before Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And when the Incenſe was conſumed, the Angel took the fire which remained upon the Altar, and filled the Cenſer with it, and caſt it to the ground, in token that the Offering of the Incenſe with the prayers of the Saints was ended: and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after that there was a great Noiſe of Thundering, and Lightning, and a very great Earth-quake, denoting God's hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Judgments which were now to fall upon the World for the wrong they did to his Saints, and for the bloud of his Saints which they had ſhed till this time, and many Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. No Prophecy is fulfilled before it be revealed; but theſe four Trumpets were revealed to <hi>John</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian,</hi>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:180584:34"/>therefore not fulfilled in <hi>Judaea</hi> before the Siege of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> by <hi>Veſpaſian.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. No Prophecy is fulfilled before it be written by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and made known unto the people, for then it is a Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and not a Prophecy; but theſe Viſions in their Opinion were written in the Reign of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> therefore not fulfilled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſiege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which began in the Reign of <hi>Nero.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſeventh Seal is not fulfilled before the ſixth; but if theſe four Trumpets be meant of the ſeditions and ſlaughters in <hi>Judaea,</hi> before the ſiege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> a good part of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Seal, even ſo much of it as is comprized in the four Trumpets, will be fulfilled before the ſixth; for the ſixth Seal in their opinion is a Prophecy of the ſiege of it ſelf, and by the Kings, and the great Men, and the rich Men, which hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Dens, they underſtand the men that hid themſelves in Caves at the taking of the City.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If theſe Trumpets be meant of the ſeditions and ſlaughters of the <hi>Jews</hi> before the ſiege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> what is the difference between theſe Trumpets and the ſecond Seal? For they ſay the ſecond Seal is meant of the ſlaughters and ſeditions of the <hi>Jews</hi> by one another before the ſiege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and if theſe Trumpets be meant of them too, what difference is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If theſe Trumpets be a Prophecy of the ſeditions of the <hi>Jewes;</hi> why do they not tell us what ſedition is meant by the firſt Trumpet, what ſedition by the ſecond, and what ſedition by the third? And if it be ſaid that they are meant of the ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Jews</hi> in groſſe, what is this but to make a <hi>Chaos</hi> of the <hi>Revelation?</hi> To which may be added, that they told us before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. that the things which <hi>Chriſt</hi> foretold concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Jews, Mat.</hi> 24. are ſet down in groſs in the ſixth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more particularly as they have their Execution in the

                  <p n="6">6. The Angels be not the Authors or Executioners of ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but four Angels be the Authors or Executioners of the four firſt Trumpets, and the prime Agents under God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they come to paſs, as appears not only <hi>verſ.</hi> 7.8.10. but alſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.2, 3.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Where ſhall we find in all the Scripture, that by <hi>Fire</hi> is meant ſedition? I find it ſometimes taken for affliction, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and temptation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.12. <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.9. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.12. but for fedition never.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. If by <hi>Fire</hi> in theſe Trumpets be meant ſedition, what is meant by <hi>Hail</hi> in the firſt Trumpet? is that ſedition too? where have they a preſident for that? How is it that men interpret Scripture, and have no Scripture for what they ſay? To which may be added, that Fire is hot and dry, but Hail is cold and moiſt, and how can theſe two be ſymbols of the ſame thing in one, and the ſame Prophecy? ſurely if the Fire be ſedition, the Hail muſt be ſome other thing.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. If by <hi>Fire</hi> be meant ſedition, what is meant by <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>green Graſs</hi> which the Fire burnt up, <hi>v.</hi> 7? Here they tell us that by <hi>green Graſs</hi> is meant the <hi>righteous,</hi> but what is meant by <hi>Trees</hi> they do not tell us, perhaps they think that by <hi>Trees</hi> is meant the <hi>righteous</hi> too? but this is not ſo, for but the third part of the Trees was burnt up, but all the green Graſs was burnt up, and none left, and therefore the Graſs is one thing, and the Trees another thing.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Where ſhall we find in all the Scripture, that by <hi>green graſs</hi> is meant the <hi>righteous?</hi> True it is, that <hi>green trees</hi> are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:180584:35"/>taken for the <hi>righteous, Luk.</hi> 23.31. but <hi>green Graſs</hi> never.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The green Graſs is oppoſed to thoſe which have the ſeal of God in their foreheads, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.4. now by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is meant the righteous, therefore by the former is meant ſome other thing.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. If by <hi>Fire</hi> be meant ſedition, what is meant by <hi>Sea</hi> in the ſecond Trumpet, where 'tis ſaid that a <hi>great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain burning with Fire, was caſt into the Sea?</hi> here they tell us that by <hi>Sea</hi> is meant the <hi>Land of Galilee,</hi> why do they not alſo ſay that by the <hi>earth</hi> in the firſt Trumpet, upon which alſo <hi>Fire</hi> was caſt, is meant the <hi>Sea</hi> of <hi>Galilee?</hi> If this be not to wreſt the Scripture, I know not what is; for if by <hi>Sea</hi> be meant the <hi>Land,</hi> why may they not as well ſay, that by <hi>Land</hi> is meant the <hi>Sea?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13.

And when 'tis ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.18. <hi>the woman which thou ſaweſt is the great City which Reigneth over the Kings of the earth,</hi> why do they not ſay the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, the woman is the great Ship which Reigneth over the Kings of the Sea? But let them tell me indeed, be <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> meant by <hi>Ships?</hi> then when 'tis ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>the third part of Ships were deſtroyed,</hi> the meaning is, the third part of Cities were deſtroyed; but Hiſtory will tell us, that not <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> only, but all the Cities were deſtroyed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> except ſome few only which yielded to them of their own accord, and there was not one of three, much
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:180584:36"/>leſs two of three left remaining, which was not deſtroyed by them, and the time when this was done, was after the ſiege of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Gallus,</hi> whenas 'tis here according to their expoſition of the Trumpets ſet before it, for they will have the deſtruction of the Cities be the meaning of the ſecond Trumpet, and the ſiege of the City by <hi>Gallus</hi> the meaning of the fourth Trumpet, which cannot be, becauſe <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was beſieged firſt by <hi>Gallus,</hi> and the Cities were deſtroyed afterward, of which ſee Biſhop <hi>Uſſers Annal. p.</hi> 691, 692.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. If by <hi>Sea</hi> be meant the <hi>Land,</hi> and by <hi>Ships</hi> the <hi>Cities,</hi> what is meant by the <hi>Rivers,</hi> and <hi>Fountains</hi> of <hi>Waters</hi> in the third Trumpet? Here they tell us, that by <hi>Rivers,</hi> and <hi>Fountains</hi> of <hi>Waters,</hi> is meant the <hi>Towns</hi> and <hi>Villages.</hi> Alas wit, whither wilt thou go?

                  <p n="15">15. What is the meaning of the fourth Trumpet? Here they tell us that the fourth Trumpet is a Prophecy of the ſiege of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Gallus,</hi> but the time doth not agree with their expoſition of the Trumpets, for this ſiege of his was before the War began in <hi>Galilee,</hi> when as by their expoſition of the Trumpets it is made to ſucceed it.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. The ſmiting of the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> are uſed in Scripture, to prengure an utter deſolation of a City or Country, and not a bare ſiege and no more, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 32.7. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 13.10. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.10.31. <hi>Joel</hi> 3.15. but here they

                  <p n="17">17. If the fourth Trumpet be a Prophecy of the ſiege of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Gallus,</hi> what is meant by the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> which that Trumpet ſpeaketh of? Here they tell us that by the <hi>Sun</hi> is meant the <hi>Temple,</hi> by the <hi>Moon</hi> the <hi>City,</hi> and by the <hi>Stars</hi> the <hi>People;</hi> but by their leave, the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> are ſaid to be ſmitten in the Prophecy, ſo was not the <hi>Temple, City,</hi> nor <hi>People</hi> by <hi>Gallus:</hi> but rather as when the <hi>Syrians</hi> left the ſiege of <hi>Samaria</hi> and fled, <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> had the Victory againſt the <hi>Syrians,</hi> ſo when <hi>Gallus</hi> raiſed the ſiege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> had the Victory againſt the <hi>Romans.</hi> But why may not theſe things be underſtood lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally?

Where have we an interpretation of the myſtery as we have in other places where things are myſtically deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.7, 8.

Yea, every one takes the liberty to interpret it as his private fancy and affection leads him, and there be well nigh as many inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of the Trumpets, as there be Writers on them: and from whence doth this proceed, but from the falſe preconceived opinion that the Prophecies of the ſeven Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets be myſtically to be underſtood?</p>

But if we underſtand this Trumpet to be meant of Wars which deſtroy the body, or of Hereſies which deſtroy the ſouls of men, this Trumpet will be more griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and calamitous than the fifth, and that becauſe the Locuſts in the fifth Trumpet, do not hurt the ſoul but the body only, and they do not kill the body outright as Wars do, but hurt it only, and put it to pain, and that for five moneths and no more, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.4, 5.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This plague is the ſame for kind with the ſeventh plague of <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 9.18, 19.22, 23, 24. and what man will ſay that that <hi>Egyptian</hi> plague is myſtically to be underſtood? and if that be not, why is this?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Holy Ghoſt doth as good as ſay, that the <hi>Trees,</hi>

And Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> himſelf doth confeſs, that the Trees, and green Graſs may be ſo expounded, <hi>Comment. Apoc. p.</hi> 92.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

                  <p n="6">6. Mighty men cannot be meant by <hi>Trees,</hi> for there be little Trees as well as great, and the Hail ſpared neither of them, but fell on Trees indifferently without excepting any ſort: and though by <hi>Cedars,</hi> and Oakes of <hi>Baſhan, Eſa.</hi> 2.13. ſome underſtand mighty men, yet Trees in General cannot point out one ſort of men more than another, for there be little low Trees, as well as great and tall, and little Trees cannot note out mighty men, though great Trees ſuch as Cedars, and Oakes of <hi>Baſhan</hi> ſometimes may.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. What myſtical interpretation ſoever is put upon one Trumpet, the ſame may be put upon the other Trumpets alſo, and then what difference is between them?

                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Ships</hi> mentioned in the ſecond Trumpet, are lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to be underſtood, for they are never taken otherwiſe in Scripture; and therefore the <hi>Sea,</hi> and all that follows in that Trumpet after it are literally to be underſtood alſo.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. The Trees, the Graſs of the Earth, and the green Herbs are literally to be underſtood as was proved before, Chap. 8. Q. 3. why not the Locuſts alſo? Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> himſelf doth confeſs that the Trees may be ſo expounded Comment, <hi>Apoc. pag.</hi> 92.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. The Angels can aſſume to themſelves true bodies, the body of a man on Foot, or the body of a man on Horſe-back, and they were wont ſo to do heretofore in caſes extraordinary, as appears <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.2. <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.1, 2. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.4. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.17. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7.6. and therefore they may do ſo again in ſuch a buſineſs as is here before us. And if it be asked of me, whence they had theſe bodies which they did aſſume? To this I anſwer that the Angels cannot create them out of nothing, for that is only Gods work, and therefore they had them from God, who did either create them out of nothing, or elſe did make them out of matter preexiſtent, as the Locuſts in the former Trumpet out of ſmoak, <hi>v.</hi> 3. And if it be asked again, what became of theſe bodies when they laid them down? To this I anſwer, that they returned into their former principles again, and in caſe they were created out of nothing, they returned into nothing, and in caſe they were made of matter preexiſtent, they returned into it again: but whatever became of theſe bodies afterward, this is certain out of Scripture, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels can aſſume them, and lay them down again, for they have done ſo heretofore, and therefore they may do ſo again, in the caſe that is now before us.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Angels can make uſe of living bodies that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore created, and leave them when they have done, as <hi>Satan</hi> made uſe of the Serpent to beguile the woman, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1, 2. and the good Angel made uſe of <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſs to ſpeak unto his

                  <p n="7">7. If we read the fifteenth verſe, we ſhall there find that the <hi>Angels</hi> have a ſpecial hand in this buſineſs, for they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to ſlay the third part of men which this Army were to ſlay; and therefore we have reaſon for to think that either theſe <hi>Horſe-men</hi> be <hi>Angels,</hi> or elſe had the guidance of the <hi>Angel</hi> in this work; and we need not ſay that there were as many <hi>Angels</hi> imployed in this work, as there be Horſe-men mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 16. but four <hi>Angels</hi> beſides the <hi>Angel</hi> that did ſound this Trumpet may ſuffice to guide theſe Creatures in this work, as one Angel did ſuffice to guide the Locuſts in the former Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet.</p>

We muſt rather look that in this Book of Prophecy, ſhould be things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, unuſual, rare, and unaccuſtomed, ſuch as the plagues of <hi>Egypt</hi> were, which were never known before nor ſince, and ſuch as the Locuſts were in the former Trumpet, and the Horſes and Horſe-men in this ſixth.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The Horſes be not uſual Horſes, ſuch as men uſe in War, and therefore they that ſit on them, be not men, for how ſhould
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:180584:47"/>men come by ſuch Horſes as be here deſcribed, and what men will adventure for to ride them in caſe they could come by them? Firſt it is ſaid, that they had heads as the <hi>heads of Lions,</hi> and out of their mouths iſſued <hi>Fire, Smoak,</hi> and <hi>Brimſtone, v.</hi> 17. 2. They had <hi>tailes like to Serpents</hi> bodies, <hi>v.</hi> 19. 3. They had heads behind at the end of their tailes. 4. They had mouths in their heads, ſo that they had two mouths, as well as two heads, one before, and another behind; and the head before was like a <hi>Lions head, v.</hi> 17. and the head behind in the tail like a <hi>Serpents</hi> head, <hi>v.</hi> 19. 5. Out of both their mouths iſſued <hi>Fire, Smoak,</hi> and <hi>Brimſtone.</hi> 6. By this <hi>Fire, Smoak,</hi> and <hi>Brimſtone</hi> were the third part of men ſlain, <hi>v.</hi> 18. Never any men did ride ſuch Horſes as theſe were, nor ever will do.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The Army here ſpoken of, was <hi>two hundred thouſand thouſand;</hi> but the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Armies never were ſo many at one time, nor ever will be. They ſay <hi>Bajazet</hi> the <hi>Turk</hi> was once in the Field, with five hundred thouſand, and <hi>Tamerlan</hi> the <hi>Tartar,</hi> with thirteen hundred thouſand, but what be all theſe to two hundred thouſand thouſand? There never was ſuch an Army in the Field at one time, nor ever will be.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Armies do conſiſt of Foot, as well as Horſe, though moſt of them be Horſe; but the Army here ſpoken of, be only Horſe, and no Foot.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. The Army here ſpoken of, did fend <hi>Fire, Smoak,</hi> and <hi>Brimſtone</hi> out of their Horſes mouths, and ſlay the third part of men therewith, this the <hi>Turks</hi> never did, nor ever will or can do. And as for thoſe who think that this is meant of <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder,</hi> in which there is <hi>Fire, Smoak,</hi> and <hi>Brimſtone</hi> when they ſhoot, I think it fit to tell them that <hi>Guns</hi> and <hi>Gunpowder</hi> were not invented by the <hi>Turks,</hi> but by <hi>Bertholdus Niger,</hi> alias <hi>Swart,</hi> a <hi>German Alchymiſt,</hi> and a <hi>Franciſcan Monk,</hi> about the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:180584:47"/>year of Chriſt 1380. And <hi>Guns</hi> and <hi>Gunpowder</hi> are uſed not only by the <hi>Turks,</hi> but by other Nations in their Wars all the World over. And 'tis not the <hi>Gunpowder</hi> which doth ſlay men of it ſelf, but the Bullet which it driveth forth. And the <hi>Turks</hi> ſhoot not <hi>Gunpowder</hi> out of their Horſes mouths and tails, but out of their Iron, and their Braſen <hi>Guns,</hi> and that at one end only: ſo that <hi>Guns</hi> and <hi>Gunpowder</hi> are not intended in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, but <hi>Fire, Smoak,</hi> and <hi>Brimſtone</hi> to kill the third part of men therewith, and that without <hi>either Gunpowder, Guns</hi> or <hi>Bullet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. By this Army were the third part of men ſlain which were dwelling at <hi>Euphrates.</hi> Now the <hi>Turks</hi> be the men which dwell there, and therefore it is likely, that the <hi>Turks</hi> be the men which ſhall be ſlain by this Army, and not the Army which ſhall ſlay the third part of men; ſo that the <hi>Turks</hi> be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in this Prophecy, not as <hi>Agents,</hi> but as <hi>Patients,</hi> not as <hi>killing</hi> others, but as <hi>killed</hi> by others, and God hath ſhewed in this Prophecy, how the third part of <hi>Turks</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed, not by <hi>Jews,</hi> nor by <hi>Tartars,</hi> nor by any other men, but by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> in a ſearful manner, and yet not by them alone, but by ſtrange kind of Horſes, newly created for this purpoſe, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver known in the World before, and by <hi>Fire, Smoak,</hi> and <hi>Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi> which proceed out of their mouths, and the wonders that be in theſe Prophecies, ſo wonderful, and ſtrange, and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed, that men will not believe them, nor-think upon them in a literal ſenſe, becauſe they do not ſee them; but what ſaid <hi>Chriſt</hi> to <hi>Thomas</hi> in a matter as hard to be believed as this, <hi>Be not faithleſs; but believe, John</hi> 20.27. and ſuch things as theſe or very like them in ſome kind or other, or at leaſt in ſome degree or other, have been done already if we believe the Book of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>c.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 18, 19.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. And he had in his right hand, a little Book or Schedule, not ſealed as the other was before,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.1.</note> but wide open in the Angels hand, have nothing written in it, and he ſet his right foot upon the Sea, and his left foot upon the dry Land.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And he cryed with a loud and dreadful voice, as when a Lion roareth after his prey, and is in ſight of it; and upon this cry of his as upon a call, ſeven claps of Thunder uttered their voices in my hearing.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And when the ſeven Thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write what the ſeven Thunders had ſpoken, for they ſpake things remarkable, but I heard a voice from Heaven ſaying unto me, Conceal the things which the ſeven Thunders have ſpoken, and write them not, for they are too terrible to be revealed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And the Angel whom I ſaw ſtanding with his right foot upon the Sea, and with his left foot upon the dry Land, lifted up his hand to Heaven, as a token that he meant to ſwear.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And he ſware by the true, and ever-living God, who made the Heaven, with the things which are therein, and the earth, with the things which are therein, and the Sea, with the

As ſoon as that Angel ſhall begin to ſound, their calling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion ſhall be brought to paſs, and before that Angel ends, the reſtauration of their Kingdom ſhall be finiſhed, and this joyful news is no new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, but God hath told it his Servants the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in the old Teſtament long ago.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And the voice which I heard from Heaven before, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me ſeal up the things which the ſeven Thunders had ſpoken, and write them not, ſpake to me again the ſecond time, and ſaid unto me, Go take the little Book or Schedule, which is wide open in the hand of the Angel which ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with his right foot upon the Sea, and with his left upon the dry Land.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. So I went unto the Angel as the voice commanded me, and I ſaid unto him, Give me the little Book or Schedule which is wide open in thy right hand; and he ſaid unto me, Take and eat it, and when thou haſt ſo done, it ſhall make thy belly bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but in thy mouth it ſhall be ſweet as Hony.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. So I took the little Book or Schedule out of the Angels hand, and eat it up before him, and it was, as the Angel ſaid, in my mouth as ſweet as Hony, but when I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And he told me the meaning of it, and he ſaid unto me, Thou muſt Prophecy again before the ſixth Trumpet endeth, and thou muſt tell what ſhall befal the People of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and

                  <head>Diſputation VI.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 Queſt. <hi>Whether the little Book had any Prophecy written in it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is not ſaid in the Text, that it had any Prophecy written in it, and therefore they which ſay it had, do it upon no ground at all?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It was wide open, and not ſhut nor ſealed, therefore there was not any ſecret thing therein.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It was but one Schedule or piece of Parchment, and that a little one too, and therefore too little to contain all the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies from the eighth verſe of the tenth Chapter, to the end of the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It was far leſs than the other Book which had ſeven rolls, and ſeven ſeals to them But if all the Prophecies from the eighth verſe of the tenth Chapter, to the end of the <hi>Revelation</hi> ſhould be compriſed in it, it would be far bigger than the other Book which had ſeven rolls and ſeals to them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The other Book which had the ſeals is commended for its Prophecies, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.2, 3, 4, 5. But this Book is no where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for any Prophecy it had.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Prophecies in the following Chapters be of higher note, and far more excellent, and of more concernment than the Prophecies in the former Chapters be, and therefore they belong not to this little Book which is no where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for its Prophecies, but to the other Book with ſeven
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:180584:49"/>ſeals which hath ſo high a commendation as not any Book the like, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.3, 4, 5.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. There ſhould be by this reckoning, two Prophetical Books of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and the ſeventh verſe of the tenth Chapter, ſhould be the laſt verſe of the firſt Book, and the eighth verſe of the tenth Chapter, ſhould be the firſt verſe of the ſeeond Book: but St. <hi>John</hi> makes but one Book of all the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and he writes it all in one Volume without diviſion, and calls it a <hi>Revelation</hi> in the ſingular number, and not two <hi>Revelations</hi> in the plural number, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.1.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. By this reckoning the Prophecies of the other Book with ſeven ſeals, ſhould be mingled with the Prophecies of the little Book without ſeals, for they ſay that all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> from the eighth verſe of the tenth Chapter, to the end of the <hi>Revelation</hi> belong unto the little Book. Now if you look into the eleventh Chapter, you ſhall there find the ending of the ſixth Trumpet, <hi>v.</hi> 14. and after that the ſeventh Trumpet, or ſome part thereof, from the fifteenth verſe to the end of the Chapter, both which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto the other Book with ſeven ſeals, and namely to the ſeventh ſeal thereof, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.2. and after this come in the Prophecies, as they ſay, of the little Book again. What a mingle mangle have we here of thoſe two Books one in another? Surely as St. <hi>John</hi> eat up the little Book, ſo they make the little Book ſwallow the Prophecies of the other Book into his Belly.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The ſixth Trumpet doth not end with the ſeventh verſe of the tenth Chapter, but goes onward to the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verſe of the eleventh Chapter, and there ends, and not before; ſo that all that Prophecy in the eleventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the fourteenth verſe, doth belong unto the other look with ſeven ſeals, and the ſeventh Trumpet doth not end
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:180584:50"/>with the eleventh Chapter, for if it did, a cloſe would have been put unto it at the end of that Chapter, to diſtinguiſh it from the Prophecies that follow; but there being no period put unto it there, as there is to the former Trumpets where they end, it is an Argument ſufficient that it doth not end there, but is to be extended farther, even to the twelfth Chapter, and to all the Chapters following incluſively until a Period be put unto it, which is no where to be found, ſo that the ſeventh Trumpet hath no end at all, nor any cloſe put unto it, as the fifth and ſixth Trumpets have, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.14. and ſeeing the ſeventh Trumpet doth belong unto the Book with ſeven ſeals, the Prophecy of the twelfth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and of all the reſt that follow, doth belong unto that other Book alſo.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. If the little Book had the following Prophecies written in it from the eighth verſe of this Chapter, to the end of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> what's the reaſon that the Angel doth acquaint <hi>John</hi> with them afterward? A man would think that after he had taken the Book, and eaten it up, he ſhould have known what the Prophecies had been which were contained in it without any further help, or any further <hi>Revelation:</hi> but we find, that in the next Chapter after this, the Angel doth acquaint <hi>John</hi> with the Prophecies of that Chapter, and tells him what they be from point to point; and therefore the little Book, though eaten up by him, did not acquaint him with them before, nor tell him what they were.</p>
                  <p>Ob. <hi>But why was</hi> John <hi>commanded to eat the little Book, if it had no Prophecy written in it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. To acquaint him with the ſweetneſs, and the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of the Prophecies which follow; for by eating of the Book which was ſweet in his mouth, and bitter in his belly, he thereby knew that the Prophecies which follow ſhould be be ſweet in the beginning, but bitter afterward. 2. To ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:180584:50"/>unto him that he had not made an end of Prophecying, and in particular, that the Prophecy of the ſixth Trumpet was not fully ended, there was a little more behind, not yet revealed to him, which he was to add to the former part thereof, and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>thou muſt Prophecy again,</hi> not begin a new Prophecy, <hi>ab ovo</hi> from the firſt Original, but Prophecy <hi>again,</hi> (that is) of the other part behind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the ſixth Trumpet, which was not ſpoken of before; but what that other part was, was not written in the little Book, but reported to him by word of mouth, and it belongs all of it to the ſixth Trumpet, and the little Book it ſelf to boot.</p>
                  <p>From hence it follows, 1. That the whole Prophetical part of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> doth not conſiſt of two main Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, both of them beginning their race at the ſame Epoche (or <hi>terminus à quo</hi>) of time, and concluding together like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe at the ſame goal or <hi>terminus ad quem.</hi> The firſt of theſe (as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> would have it) is <hi>prophetia ſigillorum</hi> reaching from the fourth Chapter unto almoſt the end of the tenth. The ſecond is <hi>prophetia libri,</hi> beginning at the eighth verſe of the tenth Chapter, and reaching to the end of the Book. But herein Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> is exceedingly out, for there is but one Prophetical Book of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> as hath been proved in this Queſtion, and this Book is <hi>Prophetia ſigillorum</hi> the Prophecy of the ſeals reaching from the fourth Chapter, or rather from the ſixth Chapter to the end of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> 2. That the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> ſhall come to paſs in order, as they came forth out of the ſealed Book, ſeal after ſeal, Trumpet after Trumpet, Vial after Vial, and ſo of all the reſt in order as they were preſented unto <hi>Iohn</hi> in Viſion, of which more in the next Queſtion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Queſt. <hi>Whether the Prophecies of the</hi> Revelation <hi>ſhall come to paſs in order as they were revealed to</hi> John?</p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:180584:51"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Things revealed at once, and not at ſeveral di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant times, come to paſs in order as they be revealed; as for inſtance: The Prophecy of the four Monarchiles, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. was revealed to <hi>Daniel</hi> all at once, and it did, and ſhall come to paſs in order as it was revealed; ſo the Prophecy of the <hi>Ram,</hi> and <hi>Hee-Goat, Dan.</hi> 8. was revealed to him all at once, and it came to paſs in order as it was revealed; and ſo give inſtance where you will, it never failes. But now the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> were revealed to <hi>Iohn</hi> all at once, and not at ſeveral diſtant times as was proved at large <hi>Diſp.</hi> 1. <hi>q.</hi> 2. therefore they ſhall come to paſs in order as they were revealed. It is otherwiſe where things are revealed at ſeveral diſtant times, here no ſuch order is obſerved; as for inſtance: The Prophecy of the fourth beaſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to him above a year before the Prophecy of the <hi>Ram</hi> and <hi>Hee-Goat</hi> mentioned <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. but yet the Prophecy of the <hi>Ram</hi> and <hi>Hee-Goat</hi> came to paſs before it. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, had the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> been revealed to <hi>Iohn</hi> at ſeveral diſtant times, as ſome of <hi>Daniels</hi> Prophecies were, we could not conclude from thence that they ſhall come to paſs in order as they were revealed; but in regard they were revealed to him all at once, or at one continued time without ceaſing or intermiſſion of his ecſtaſie, we may and muſt conclude from thence that they ſhall come to paſs in order as they were revealed, and preſented unto <hi>Iohn</hi> in Viſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> were written all of them in one Book, and not in two, and that was the Book ſealed with ſeven ſeals, <hi>c.</hi> 5. But as for the little Book, <hi>c.</hi> 10. it had not any Prophecy written in it, as was proved at large in the former Queſtion. Now had the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> been written in two Books, and not in one, it might be poſſible that the Prophecies of theſe two Books
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:180584:51"/>might begin their race at the ſame Epoche (or <hi>terminus a quo</hi>) of time, and conclude together likewiſe at the ſame goal or <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus ad quem:</hi> but in regard they were all of them writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in one Book, and not in two, here is no colour at all for ſuch a groundleſs imagination.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hiſtories write of things in order as they come to paſs, as if a man were to write a <hi>Chronicle</hi> of the Kings of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> he would not put King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth and his Reign, before King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, but ſet down the Kings in order as they Reigned. And no other is the caſe here, the prophetical part of the <hi>Revelations</hi> is a Hiſtory of things to come, as a <hi>Chronicle</hi> is a Hiſtory of things paſt, and therefore it ſets down things in order, as a <hi>Chronicle</hi> doth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is acknowledged by Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> and others of his mind, that all the Prophecies in the <hi>Revelation</hi> (except that of the Palm-bearers <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.9.) from the beginning of the ſixth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the middle of the tenth ſhall come to paſs in order as they were Revealed, but the grand Queſtion is of thoſe which follow after. Now that the Prophecies which follow after from the beginning of the eleventh Chapter to the end of the <hi>Revelation</hi> ſhall come to paſs in order as they were Revealed, ſhall be proved ſeverally of them all when I come to write on thoſe Chapters, ſee <hi>Ch.</hi> 11. <hi>q.</hi> 1. <hi>ch.</hi> 12. <hi>q.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>ch.</hi> 13. <hi>q.</hi> 1. <hi>ch.</hi> 16. <hi>q.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p n="5">Firſt, ſecond, third, fourth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all of them ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal numbers and not cardinal, and they are ſo called becauſe they ſhew not only the number of things ſpoken of, but the order alſo. Now the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> do all of them conſiſt of theſe numbers, ſeven Seals, ſeven Trumpets, ſeven Vials conſiſting all of them of ordinal numbers, whereof the ſeven Trumpets are the iſſue of the ſeventh Seal, and therefore ſhall come to paſs in order after the ſixth Seal is ended, and the ſeven Vials are the iſſue of the ſeventh Trumpet (though not

What Man will ſay that King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth? ſuch an abſurdity do they run into which interpret the ſixth Seal of the day of Judgment, and make the ſeventh Seal which contains the ſeven Trumpets to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. It is as if a Man ſhould ſay that King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh was before King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and the reaſon why King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth is ſet before King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh in the <hi>Engliſh Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles</hi> is becauſe he was firſt revealed unto the Writer, but in order of Reigning King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh was before him.</p>

But if any one think otherwiſe, that the ſixth Seal ſhall come to paſs after the ſeven Trumpets, let him tell me why was it revealed before the ſeven Trumpets were, and not tather after them. And ſo of other Prophecies it may be asked, if that which was revealed firſt, ſhall come to paſs after that which was revealed afterward, why was it revealed firſt? Give an anſwer he that will.</p>

                        <hi>The firſt Synchroniſm of the woman remaining in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of the ſeven headed beaſt reſtored, of the outer Court troden under foot by the Gentiles, of the witneſſes in the mean time Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying in Sackcloth.</hi> All which he will have Synchroniſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be of <hi>equal times.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To which I anſwer, that the month of <hi>April</hi> hath as many days as the month of <hi>Iune,</hi> and the month of <hi>Iune</hi> hath as many days as the month of <hi>September,</hi> yet theſe three months ſucceed one another; and no other is the caſe here. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying of the <hi>witneſſes</hi> in Sack-cloth, hath as many days as the <hi>woman</hi> hath in the Wilderneſs, and that is 1260 days, and the <hi>woman</hi> hath as many days in the Wilderneſs as the 42 months of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> amount unto, yet they ſucceed one another, as the month of <hi>Iune</hi> ſucceeds the month of <hi>April,</hi> and the month of <hi>September</hi> ſucceeds them both. But as for the conculcation of the outer Court 42 months, and the Prophecying of the witneſſes in the mean while 1260 days, I confeſs that they Synchroniſe, but none of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> ſaw the weakneſs of his firſt Argument, and in the cloſe thereof confeſſeth that it is not neceſſary that equal times ſhould Synchroniſe, howbeit, for confirmation of it, he adds in his Parentheſis, that in Viſions ſhewed at the ſame time, it is very likely that they do.</p>
                     <p>To which I anſwer, that this doth no way ſtrengthen nor add any confirmation to his Argument, for equal times pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented all at once, at one view, may and do ſucceed one another, as appears in a leafe Almanack wide open, where
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:180584:53"/>all the months of the year (many of which are equal one to another, and have as many days, one as another,) are preſented to my eye all at once at one view, yet they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed one another, the month of <hi>March</hi> ſucceeds the month of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> though equal in duration to it, and the month of <hi>May,</hi> (though of equal duration too) ſucceeds them both. So put the caſe that theſe Prophecies were preſented unto <hi>Iohn</hi> the ſame time at one view, yet may they ſucceed one another for all that. But the caſe is not ſo in the point in hand, for theſe Prophecies were not preſented unto <hi>Iohn</hi> at one view, as the Image was to <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> in his dream, but ſucceſſively one after another, the Prophecy of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in the eleventh Chapter firſt, the Prophecy of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Wilderneſs, in the twelfth Chapter, next, and the Prophecy of the Beaſt, in the thirteenth Chapter, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward. And becauſe they were preſented unto him ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, therefore we conclude that they ſhall come to paſs ſucceſſively, the Prophecy in the eleventh Chapter firſt, the Prophecy in the twelfth Chapter next, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy in the thirteenth Chapter, afterward. And thus much for the firſt Argument.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He undertakes to prove that the times of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and of the womans being in the Wilderneſs, begin at the ſame inſtant of time, to wit the Conqueſt of the red Dragon, and the thruſting him out of Heaven unto the earth, but he mightily fails in the probation of it. 1. In that he makes the Dragon caſt out a flood of water after her, before ſhe came into the Wilderneſs as ſhe was flying thither, but it is not ſo, for the woman gets into the Wilderneſs firſt, as appears <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.14. and then he ſends a flood of water af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her to drive her out from thence, as appears <hi>v.</hi> 15.2. He thinks that by the <hi>remnant of her ſeed,</hi> is meant the Children which the woman ſhould bring forth in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:180584:54"/>and that the Dragon makes War with them in that place, but this is nothing ſo, but by the remnant of her ſeed is meant, thoſe which did remain behind, and were not fled into the Wilderneſs with the woman, for if they had been there, they had been ſafe as the woman was, <hi>v.</hi> 14. and the Dragon could not War with them, nor get the Victory over them in that place. Briefly then, the order of the Prophecy is this: 1. The Dragon perſecutes the woman, and that as ſoon as he was caſt forth of Heaven unto the earth, <hi>v.</hi> 13.2. The woman flies and gets ſafe into the Wilderneſs from his perſecution, <hi>v.</hi> 14.3. The Dragon caſts forth a flood of water after her, to drive her out from thence, <hi>v.</hi> 15.4. The earth opens her mouth, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows up the flood of water, <hi>v.</hi> 16.5. The Dragon ſeeing that, leaves the woman in the Wilderneſs, and departs from thence (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) to make War with the remnant of her ſeed, <hi>v.</hi> 17. and who be they, but thoſe which were not fled into the Wilderneſs where the woman was? This is the true ſenſe, and order of the Prophecy, and I wonder that any man ſhould ſet his wit againſt it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He would have the times of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and of the witneſſes end together at the <hi>exit</hi> of the ſixth Trumpet, and this he thinks to prove from <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.13, 14, 15. but all in vain, for though the times of the witneſſes do end at the <hi>exit</hi> of the ſixth Trumpet, and we hear no more of them afterward, yet the times of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> do not, as may appear if theſe things be conſidered. 1. The City there ſpoken of is not <hi>Babylon</hi> the Royal City of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> but <hi>Ieruſalem, v.</hi> 2. and 8.2. The whole City doth not fall, but the tenth part only, <hi>v.</hi> 13.3. That tenth part of the City fell by an earth-quake, but <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall be conſumed by fire, and not by an earth-quake, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.8.4. Seven thouſand men are ſlain, and no more, <hi>v.</hi> 13. and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:180584:54"/>what is ſo ſmall a number to the ruine of the <hi>Beaſt?</hi> 5. Though at the ſound of the ſeventh Trumpet, <hi>the Kingdoms of this World become the Kingdoms of the Lord, and his Chriſt,</hi> yet this is but <hi>in fieri</hi> at that time, and not <hi>in facto eſſe,</hi> it is then a doing, and not intirely done, it is then <hi>in eſſe inchoato,</hi> in inchoation only, not <hi>in eſſe completo,</hi> in complete perfection, it is then in the bud, and in the bloſſom, but not come to full maturity till afterward, and as long as it is ſo, and no more, the <hi>Beaſt</hi> may have a being in the World, after the ſeventh Trumpet ſounds, until the Kingdom of Chriſt be brought to full perfection. In a word, the ſeventh Trumpet is to ſound more days than one, as the Angel ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.7. Now the firſt day that Trumpet ſounds, the Kingdoms of the World are become the Kingdoms of the Lord and his Chriſt <hi>inchoative</hi> inchoatively, but when the ſeventh Trumpet hath ſounded many days, and when all the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> from the eleventh Chapter to the twentieth are fulfilled, then the Kingdom of Chriſt ſhall be brought to full perfection, and then the <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſhall have a final end, and not before. And here it is to be noted, that the <hi>Beaſt</hi> which Wars againſt the Witneſſes, <hi>ch.</hi> 11. is not the ſame with the <hi>Beaſt</hi> which overcomes the Saints, <hi>ch.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 7. of which more hereafter in its proper place.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. He will have the times of the witneſſes, and of the Court or Holy City poſſeſſed by the Gentiles, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.2, 3. to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate, and this I grant to be true, for the 42 months of the Gentiles in which they ſhall tread the Holy City under foot, <hi>v.</hi> 2. and the 1260 days in which the Witneſſes ſhall Prophecy, <hi>v.</hi> 3. are the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. He concludes the Synchroniſm with an inference. <hi>If the treading underfoot of the Court, and Holy City, do contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate with the Prophecy of the Witneſſes, it will alſo contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with the Beaſt.</hi> And this I deny, for the Witneſſes do
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:180584:55"/>not contemporate with the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> only the two firſt do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporate, <hi>viz.</hi> the 42 months of the Gentiles, and the 1260 days of the Witneſſes, but the reſt ſucceed one another, the woman in the Wilderneſs ſucceeds the times of the Witneſſes, and the <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſucceeds them both. And thus much in anſwer to the firſt Synchroniſm.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The ſecond Synchroniſm, is of the two horned Beaſt, (who is alſo the falſe Prophet) with the ten horned Beaſt, who is alſo called the Image of the Beaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> And this is true, if meant of the time which ſucceeds his reſtauration; for as ſoon as the wounded Beaſt is healed, the other Beaſt is raiſed to counſel and aſſiſt him, and from that time forth they Synchroniſe. But whereas he thinks they were raiſed, the one out of the Sea, and the other out of the earth both together, it is nothing ſo, for the ten horned Beaſt is raiſed firſt, and in that reſpect is called the firſt Beaſt, <hi>v.</hi> 12. and after he is raiſed, he is wounded, and when his wound is healed, then the other Beaſt is raiſed, and not before. And thus much of the ſecond Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chroniſm.</p>
                     <p>And as for the Appendix, becauſe it makes nothing to the Synchroniſm, whether it be true or falſe, I omit to ſpeak unto it; only I think it not amiſs to acquaint the Reader, that the ten horned beaſt is not the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> as he would have it, but the <hi>object</hi> repreſented by the <hi>Image.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The third Synchroniſm is of the great Whore, or myſtical</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, <hi>with that ſame Beaſt which hath ſeven heads and ten Horns.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> If this were meant of the <hi>Beaſt ch.</hi> 17. it were true, and not to be denied, but it being meant of the <hi>Beaſt ch.</hi> 13. it is falſe, for that <hi>Beaſt</hi> outlives the Whore, and Wars <hi>againſt him that ſate upon the White Horſe,</hi> that is, againſt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:180584:55"/>Chriſt, after the Whore is deſtroyed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.19, 20. And the Synchroniſm doth ſuppoſe theſe Beaſts to be all one, of which more hereafter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The fourth Synchroniſm, is of the</hi> 144000 <hi>Sealed Virgins, with the Whore of</hi> Babylon, <hi>and the Beaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Five Arguments are brought to prove their Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſing. The three firſt as he confeſſeth are inſufficient to make up a full and entire contemporiſing, for they may all conſiſt but with a partial. The fourth Argument is brought to prove a total contemporiſing, but it comes ſhort of it, as the three other did, for though theſe Virgins be <hi>antiſtoechal</hi> to the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and all his followers, yet this is only at his declination, and not before; and though they be the Servants of God, and wear his Livery, and have his name written in their foreheads, yet God had other Servants beſides theſe which had to deal with the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and he with them before theſe had, and they be the remnant of the womans ſeed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.7. but theſe Virgins advance againſt him afterward, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.1, 2. It is true if God had had no more Servants to oppoſe the <hi>Beaſt</hi> but theſe only, then muſt theſe have been <hi>antiſtoechal</hi> to the <hi>Beaſt</hi> throughout from his firſt breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to his laſt gaſp; but God had other Servants to oppoſe the <hi>Beaſt</hi> before theſe did, and they are the remnant of the womans ſeed, as was ſaid before, therefore theſe are actually <hi>antiſtoechal</hi> to him afterward, when the other have done their work, and not before. The laſt Argument ſpeaks expreſly of a final contemporiſing, and no more, which I grant to be true, though I diſlike the <hi>medium</hi> which is brought to prove it. The truth of the Synchroniſm which we have in hand, is this, the Virgin company of the Sealed are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedaneous to the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> for they are Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the time of the ſixth Seal, which is before the times of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and falſe Prophet do commence, but yet they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:180584:56"/>advance not againſt him, nor have to deal with him, nor he with them, until his 42 months be ended, and then they ſtep forth againſt him, and get the Victory over him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.2. And as for the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> we have a Prophecy of her fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ruine, which is to come to paſs in the time of the ſeventh Vial, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.1. but of her firſt beginning, when ſhe began to be a Whore, we want a Prophecy in the <hi>Revelation</hi> to inform us of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The fifth is a conſectary of the general Synchroniſm of all hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mentioned.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> His inference is, that they all Synchroniſe; my infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is from what I have ſaid and proved, that only the conculcation of the holy City 42 months, and the Witneſſes in the mean time Prophecying in Sackeloth 1260 days are Synchronals, but all the reſt ſucceed one another. The whole Prophecy of the twelfth Chapter, ſhall ſucceed the Prophecy in the eleventh Chapter, the Prophecy in the thirteenth Chapter, ſhall ſucceed the Prophecy of the twelfth Chapter, the Prophecy of the fourteenth Chapter, ſhall ſucceed the Prophecy of the thirteenth Chapter, and the Prophecy in the ſeventeenth Chapter, concerning the fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſhall be the laſt that ſhall come to paſs of all that have been hitherto ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of.</p>

                        <pb n="105" facs="tcp:180584:56"/>Travel, and the Dimication of the <hi>Dragon</hi> with <hi>Michael</hi> do contemporate, and the flight of the <hi>woman</hi> into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs immediately ſucceed them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.6, 13, 14. yet the ſeven headed <hi>Beaſt</hi> reſtored doth not immediately ſucceed the <hi>Duel,</hi> in which <hi>Michael</hi> over-threw the <hi>Dragon;</hi> for the <hi>Dragon</hi> doth not immediately raiſe the <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſo ſoon as he is caſt out of Heaven unto the Earth, but before he attempt ſuch a Work, he firſt of all perſecutes the <hi>woman,</hi> Rev. 12.13. then the <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> flies into the Wilderneſs, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. after that he ſends a Floud of Water after her to carry her away, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. then the Earth ſwallows up the floud of Water, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. and when all this is done, then he leaves the Wilderneſs, and goes into the Sea, from whence he raiſes up the <hi>Beaſt</hi> to War againſt the Remnant of the Womans Seed and not before, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17, 18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.1. 3. That the meaſuring of the inner Court ſhall precede the conculcation of the outer Court I grant, and that the forty two Months in which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhall tread it under foot, begin when the meaſuring of the inner Court is ended; but that the meaſuring of this inner Court ſhall ſynchroniſe with the <hi>womans</hi> Travel, and the Dimication of <hi>Michael</hi> with the <hi>Dragon,</hi> I deny, and that becauſe the conculcation of the outer Court, and the Habitation of the <hi>woman</hi> in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, do not ſynchroniſe, but ſucceed each other, as hath been proved in my Anſwer to the firſt ſynchroniſm; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the meaſuring of the inner Court ſhall precede the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcation of the outer, ſo they both ſhall precede the <hi>womans</hi> Travel; and as the <hi>womans</hi> Travel ſhall precede her flight, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation in the Wilderneſs, ſo the habitation of the <hi>woman</hi> in the Wilderneſs ſhall precede the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and all his Actings againſt the Remnant of her Seed. Laſtly, Whereas he talks of a repeated Prophecy, he ſhould have firſt proved a repeated Prophecy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had ſaid ſo much of it, or built an Argument upon it, for there is no repeated Prophecy in the <hi>Revelation.</hi> And when the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:180584:57"/>Angel ſaith, <hi>Oportet te iterum prophetare,</hi> thou muſt propheſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.11. the meaning is not that he muſt begin a new Prophecy, <hi>ab ovo,</hi> from the firſt Original, repeating the ſame times over again; but the meaning is, that he muſt propheſie of other things, and of other times, which ſhall ſucceed the former, and which he had not ſpoken of before.</p>

I proceed now with the like Candor and Ingenuity, to ſpeak unto the reſt of the Synchroniſms which follow; but before I begin, I muſt premiſe a few things in anſwer to his Prologue. 1. That the little Book had not any Prophecy written in it as hath been proved in the former Queſtion. 2. That upon this account the <hi>Revelation,</hi> or the prophetical part thereof may not fitly be divided into two main Prophecies, as he would have it, whereof the firſt is <hi>Prophetia ſigillorum,</hi> the prophecy of the Seals, reaching from the fourth Chapter (or rather from the ſixth Chapter) to almoſt the end of the tenth; the ſecond (as he would have it) is <hi>Prophetia libri,</hi> the prophecy of the little Book beginning at the eighth Verſe of the tenth Chapter, and reaching to the end of the <hi>Revelation:</hi> I ſay, that this may not fitly be done, becauſe there is but one prophecy of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                        <pb n="107" facs="tcp:180584:57"/>and that is <hi>Prophetia ſigillorum,</hi> the prophecy of the Seals which begins at the ſixth Chapter, and reacheth to the end of the <hi>Revelation;</hi> for as for the little Book, it had not any prophecy written in it, and Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> ſhould have proved, that the little Book had all the prophecies in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> from the eighth Verſe of the tenth Chapter to the end of the Book, written in it, and not have ſuppoſed it ſo to be. 3. That becauſe there is but one Book of prophecy and not two, therefore the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the eleventh Chapter, and ſo onwards, which are ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to the little Book, ſhall not begin their race at the ſame Epoche that the Seals do, and ſo run along with them <hi>ad eandem metam,</hi> to the ſame Goal, for this were to make two Books of prophecy, when there is but one. 4. Suppoſe it to be true (as he ſaith) that the <hi>Revelation</hi> doth conſiſt of too main prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and the firſt of them to be <hi>Prophetia ſigillorum,</hi> the prophecy of the Seals, reaching from the fourth Chapter to almoſt the end of the tenth, the other to be <hi>Prophetia libri,</hi> the prophecy of the little Book, beginning at the eighth Verſe of the tenth Chapter, and reaching to the end of the <hi>Revelation:</hi> Yet it no way follows, that theſe two prophecies muſt contemporate, or begin their race at the ſame Epoche of time, and conclude toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the ſame Goal, for the latter may begin where the other left for all that. 5. Suppoſe the Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> might fitly be divided into two Tomes, and the ſecond Tome to begin at the eighth Verſe of the tenth Chapter, at theſe Words, <hi>And the voyce which I heard from Heaven ſpake unto me again;</hi> yet by that voyce is not meant, the voyce mentioned <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. but the voyce mentioned <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. and by the Words, <hi>Thou muſt prophecy again,</hi> is not meant, that he muſt begin a new prophecy, <hi>ab ovo,</hi> from the firſt Original, but rather that he muſt begin where he left before. As if a man were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to write a Hiſtory of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in two Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes; the firſt Volume beginning with the Reign of <hi>Saul,</hi>
                        <pb n="108" facs="tcp:180584:58"/>and ending with the Reign of <hi>David;</hi> the other Volume begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the Reign of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and ending with the Reign of <hi>Zedekiah;</hi> doth not this laſt Volume begin where the other left? And no other is the caſe here. Suppoſe the prophecies of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> to conſiſt of two Tomes, the one reaching from the fourth (or ſixth Chapter, to the eighth Verſe of the tenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the other from thence to the end of the Book, this laſt tome doth not contemporate with the former, but ſucceeds it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to Prophecy where the other left. 6. We read not that the voice <hi>ch.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 8. was as the ſound of a Trumpet, and therefore not likely to relate to the voice, <hi>ch.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 1. but rather to the voice, <hi>ch.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 4. for that voice, <hi>ch.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 1. is ſaid to be as the ſound of a Trumpet, but this not. But to what purpoſe he would have the Reader take notice of this, I cannot tell; Is this an <hi>Index</hi> that the Prophecy of the little Book, (as he calls it) doth contemporate with the Prophecy of the Seals? No more than the voice, <hi>ch.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 1. is an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex</hi> that the Prophecy of the Seals doth contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate with the Viſion of the ſeven Churches;<note place="margin">

Laſtly, you may be ſure that it is not ſo as he ſaith, that the ſecond Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, or the Prophecy of the little Book doth begin at the eighth verſe of the tenth Chapter, and reach from thence to the end of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> becauſe <hi>Ch.</hi> 11. you have the Period of the ſixth Trumpet, and the beginning of the ſeventh, from the fourteenth verſe to the end of the Chapter, both which belong (not unto the little Book) but to the Prophecy of the Seals, as you may ſee if you look into his ſcheme. And thus much by way of anſwer to his Preface I come now to the Synchroniſms themſelves.</p>

                        <hi>The firſt Synchroniſm which is the principal one, is of the ſeventh Seal, ſo far as the ſix firſt Trumpets reach with the ten horned, and two horned Beaſts, and the reſt contemporiſers.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> To which I anſwer firſt in general, that the beginning of the Beaſt doth not contemporate with the beginning of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Seal, as he would have it, nor the end of the Beaſt contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate with the <hi>exit</hi> of the ſixth Trumpet, therefore here is no Synchroniſing. 2. I anſwer to each branch of the Argument in particular, and</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I ſay that the beginning of the Beaſt, doth not contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate with the beginning of the ſeventh Seal, but is the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of the ſeventh Trumpet, and comes forth into the World after the ſeventh Trumpet is begun, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.1. 2. One oppoſite may be before another, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Goliah,</hi> who were deadly oppoſites one unto another, yet <hi>Goliah</hi> was the elder, and <hi>David</hi> was the younger, and did outlive <hi>Goliah:</hi> ſo though theſe Sealed Virgins be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the Beaſt Reigning, yet the Virgins are the elder Company, and are Sealed by the Angel before the Beaſt has a being in the World. Oppoſition implies a partial contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, not a total. 3. In what reſpect are the Sealed Virgins oppoſite to the Beaſt, but in reſpect of Religion, and warlike perſecution for Religion? And how either of theſe ſeverally, or both of them joyntly, can cauſe a total contemporation, I am yet to ſeek. For inſtance, The Chriſtians, and the <hi>Turks</hi> are oppoſites in reſpect of their Religion, and who knows not but that the Chriſtian Religion, was before the <hi>Turkiſh?</hi> And they be alſo oppoſite in reſpect of War, and yet this made them not contemporate, but come behind the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. So what if theſe Virgins be oppoſite to the Beaſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Religion, is not their Religion before his? And what if difference in Religion produce a War betwixt them, doth not this War ſucceed Religion, and the Beaſt that is raiſed
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:180584:59"/>to begin this War, ſucceed it too? 4. If you look into the text, you ſhall find that theſe Virgins, though they be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Beaſt in reſpect of their Sealing, yet they actually oppoſe him not in his Wars until his declination; then it is that they actually advance againſt him, and not before. And if it be asked of me, who they were that oppoſed him in his Wars before his declination? I ſay, they were the remnant of the womans ſeed whom he warreth with, and overcomes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.17, 18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.7. but the Sealed ones advance againſt him afterward, and get the Victory over him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.2. 5. The Sealed ones are Sealed at the ſixth Seal, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before the ſeventh Seal begins, and therefore they be more ancient than the Beaſt who hath no being in the World till the ſeventh Trumpet is begun, and ſo much thereof as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the twelfth Chapter paſt before he riſeth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.1. 6. The contemporation he hath proved in the fourth Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chroniſm of his firſt part, is but a partial contemporation, and comes far ſhort of a total; for which ſee the Synchroniſm it ſelf, and my anſwer to it. 7. The Sealed ones are the Servants of God before that they be Sealed, for the Seal doth not make them ſuch, but find them ſo to be, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.3. And in this reſpect too they are more ancient than the Beaſt, and do no otherwiſe contemporate with him, than as an elder contemporates with a younger man. 8. The reaſon why the Seal is put upon them in the ſixth Seal, is not to call them forth againſt the Beaſt, but to preſerve them againſt the ſtorms of the enſuing Trumpets. And this is a ſufficient anſwer to the firſt branch of the Synchroniſm, that the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Beaſt doth not contemporate with the ſeventh Seal.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I ſay that the end of the Beaſt doth not contemporate with the <hi>exit</hi> of the ſixth Trumpet; for though it be true, that the 1260 days of the two Witneſſes do end at the <hi>exit</hi>
                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:180584:59"/>of the ſixth Trumpet, yet that the 42 months of the Beaſt do end at that time too, I deny. 2. Inſtead of proving that the 42 months of the Beaſt are ended at the <hi>exit</hi> of the ſixth Trumpet, he ſaith, that <hi>it is demonſtrated already, part</hi> 1. <hi>Synch.</hi> 1. §. 3. whither I refer the Reader for better ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. And by the anſwer which I have given to it he ſhall find, that it is no more proved there, than it is here; for if you look into the Text, you ſhall find that the great City did not fall at the <hi>exit</hi> of the ſixth Trumpet, but the tenth part of it fell, and no more: and by the City in that place is not meant the Throne of the Beaſt, but the holy City which the Gentiles trample under foot 42 months, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.2. 3. He ſaith, <hi>by reaſon of the deſtruction which he then felt, the Beaſt was at the laſt gaſp or giving up the Ghoſt;</hi> but if you look into the Text, you ſhall find that ſeven thouſand men are ſlain in the earthquake, and no more, and what is ſo ſmall a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to the expiration of the Beaſt, or to his laſt gaſp? No more than the loſs of ſeven thouſand men is to the ruine of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire. For ſuppoſe the <hi>Turk</hi> ſhould ſend an Army from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to ſlay the <hi>Jews</hi> and Chriſtians that be there, and after this is done, ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of his men ſhould be ſlain by an earthquake, what is this to the ruine of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire? And no other is the caſe here; The Beaſt ſends his Soldiers to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which ſlay the two Witneſſes which Preach the Goſpel there, and after this is done, ſeven thouſand of his men loſe their lives by an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, what is this to the ruine of the Beaſt? No more than the loſs of ſeven thouſand men, is to the ruine of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire. 4. He ſaith, <hi>that we might know in what time of the Seals and Trumpets this ſhould happen, the ſpirit immediately joyned the ſecond wo, that is, the ſixth Trumpet even then to be paſt:</hi> but he ſhould have proved that the Beaſt was then paſt, and not that the ſecond Wo was then paſt; which laſt I grant
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:180584:60"/>to be true, but the other I deny. Laſtly, he ſaith, <hi>leſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily it ſhould raiſe a ſcruple in any that thoſe things which are related in the Text concerning the overthrow of the Beaſt, the fall of the City, and the ſlaughter of men cauſed by the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, ought not to be underſtood of the utter deſtruction of the Beaſt,</hi> he ſaith <hi>that it is not requiſite to the Synchroniſm in hand, but that they be meant at leaſt of the ending of the time of his power and reign.</hi> But if you look into the Synchroniſm, the Words of the Synchroniſm are, <hi>Finis beſtiae contemporat cum exitu tubae ſextae,</hi> the end of the Beaſt doth contemporate with the <hi>exit</hi> of the ſixth Trumpet, not the end of the time of his Power and Reign; and if you look into the ſacred Text, there is nothing at all of the ending of his Power and Reign, nor of the time of their ending; all we find there is, that <hi>there was a great Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and the tenth part of the City fell, and in the Earthquake were ſlain ſeven thouſand Men:</hi> But what is this to the ending of his Power and Reign, or the ending of the time thereof? No more than the loſs of ſo many Men is to the abolition of the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi> Power and Kingdom. We read, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.12. that <hi>the reſt of the Beaſts had their Dominion taken away, yet their lives were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed for a ſeaſon:</hi> But we read not <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.13. that the Beaſt hath his Dominion taken away at the <hi>exit</hi> of the ſixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and his Life prolonged till the ſeventh. In a word, the Synchroniſm doth ſuppoſe things which are not to be granted. 1. That the ſealed Virgins, and the two Witneſſes be all one Company. 2. That the Beaſt <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. is the ſame with the Beaſt <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 3. That the one Thouſand two Hundred and ſixty Dayes of the Witneſſes <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.3. are the ſame with the 42. Moneths of the Beaſt <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.5. 4. That the whole time of the Beaſts Reign is determined in thoſe 42 Moneths; all which muſt be proved before the Synchroniſm can be made good. And thus much in Anſwer to the firſt Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm.</p>

                        <hi>The ſecond Synchroniſm is of the contemporating inner Court, and the battail of</hi> Michael <hi>and the Dragon, about the birth of the Child, with the ſix firſt seals.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer. 1. That the meaſuring of the inner Court, and the battail of <hi>Michael</hi> and the Dragon, about the birth of the Child, do not contemporate each with other; and therefore not contemporate with the ſix firſt Seals. 2. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they immediate Antecedents of contemporating Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaneans; for though the ſix firſt Seals be the immediate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent of the ſeventh Seal, yet the meaſuring of the inner Court, and the Dimication of <hi>Michael</hi> with the Dragon, are not the immediate Antecedents of the Beaſt, and the ſealed Virgins. 3. The ſeventh Seal, or (which is all one) the ſix firſt Trumpets, and the company of the ſealed, and the Beaſt, are not contemporants, therefore here is no Synchroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The third Synchroniſin is of the Vials, with the ſixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer. 1. That the ſeven Vials are the ſeven laſt plagues, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.1. and therefore they do not begin the ruine of the Beaſt, but end it. 2. The Kingdom of the Beaſt is not brought to ſuch a ruine in the ſixth Trumpet, as to put an end to his forty two Moneths; all that is done in that Trumpet, is the falling of the tenth part of the City, and the loſs of ſeven Thouſand men, and what is that to the ruine of the Beaſts Kingdom, or to the ending of his forty two Moneths. 3. The Beaſt ſhall have a far greater loſs than that, before any of the Vials be effuſed, for the Harveſt <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. is a far greater loſs than that in the ſixth Trumpet, and the Vintages far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Harveſt, and both of them ſhall come upon the Beaſt before any of the Vials be effuſed. 4. The fifth Vial is poured out upon the Throne of the Beaſt, but that the Beaſts Throne is touched in the time of the ſixth Trumpet, I deny. For
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:180584:61"/>by the tenth part of the City, is not meant the Throne of the Beaſt, but <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> 5. The ſeventh Vial is a conſummating Vial, and the ſeventh Trumpet a conſummating Trumpet: but this doth not make them to contemporate; for the one takes up more time in conſummating than the other doth, as having more things to conſummate than the other hath; the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. and conſummates the things from thence unto the end, the other begins <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. and reaches from thence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end of the Revelation.</p>

                        <hi>The fourth Synchroniſm is of the thouſand years of Satans being bound with the ſeventh Trumpet or the ſpace from the deſtruction of the Beaſt.</hi>

They are ſhorter <hi>à parte ante,</hi> for the thouſand years begin <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 1. but the ſeventh Trumpet begins <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15. and all the Prophecies between that Chapter, and the twentieth belong unto the ſeventh Trumpet, and not unto the little Book which had no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy written in it. Again the thouſand years expire at the enlargement of the Priſoner, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.7. but the ſeventh Trumpet goes beyond it, and contains under it, not only that enlargement, but the inſurrection and deſtruction of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> the reſurrection of the dead, and the final Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſo that the thouſand years are much ſhorter than the ſeventh Trumpet, both <hi>à parte ante</hi> on the fore part, and <hi>à parte poſt</hi> on the hinder part. To that which follows in the Synchroniſm I have no more to ſay, but what has been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to already, the reſt not ſpoken to I leave to others to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that have a mind unto it, for my opinion is, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> ſhall come to paſs in order as they were revealed.</p>

The reſt that follows in that Synchroniſm I leave to others to anſwer that be ſo minded, for my opinion is, that the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> (what ever the meaning of them be) ſhall come to paſs in order as they were revealed.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> To which I anſwer. 1. In general that the new <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> doth not begin at the deſtruction of the Beaſt, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporate with the thouſand years, but ſucceed them. 2. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to each Argument in particular.</p>
                     <p>To the firſt, I ſay that the marriage of the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.7. and the marriage, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.2.9. are not the ſame. The firſt is the perſonal marriage of Chriſt, with the ſpouſe in grace; the other is the perſonal marriage of Chriſt, with the ſpouſe in glory.</p>
                     <p>To the ſecond, I deny that the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved City which <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> ſhall environ after the thouſand years are ended, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.9. for this latter is the Church in the full ſtate of grace, but the other is the Church in the full ſtate of glory.</p>
                     <p>To the third, <hi>factum eſt,</hi> it is done, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.17. is not the ſame <hi>factum eſt</hi> with that <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.6. By the firſt is meant that the ſeven laſt plagues were then expiring, that being the laſt which then was pouring out, and the full ſtate of

                     <p>The fourth Argument proves no more than this, that the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall ſucceed the utter exſtinction of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and <hi>Babylon:</hi> but that it ſhall ſucceed immediately, 'I deny. The order ſhall be this, <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed firſt, the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and falſe Prophet next, then ſhall be the thouſand years, after them the inſurrection and deſtruction of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> after that the laſt Judgment, then the Lake of fire for the curſed, and the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for the bleſſed.</p>

                        <hi>The ſeventh Synchroniſm of the Palm-bearing multitude of the numberleſs triumphants out of all Nations, Tribes, People, and tongues,</hi> c. 7. v. 9. <hi>with the ſeventh Trumpet, or ſpace of time from ſtruction of the Beaſt,</hi> c. 11.15.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Two Arguments are brought to prove this, the firſt is to this effect, <hi>The Palm-bearing multitude immediately ſucceeds the Company of the Sealed, and that company ended with the Beaſt, at the</hi> exit <hi>of the ſixth Trumpet, therefore the Palm-bearing multitude followeth both.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> But if you look into the ſeventh Chapter, you ſhall there find they immediately ſucceed the time of their Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; not the race of the Sealed, but the time of their Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now their Sealing is in the time of the ſixth Seal, before any of the Trumpets do begin, therefore theſe Palm-bearers precede the ſeventh Trumpet, and the firſt to boot.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Argument is, <hi>that they be Citizens of the new</hi> Jeruſalem.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> But in the ſixth Seal, under which they are preſented unto <hi>John,</hi> they are not come to that eſtate at that time, their bodies being not then raiſed from the Grave, their Souls being then in Heaven in the ſtate of bliſs, at ſuch time as the Sealed ones are Sealed on earth.</p>

                     <p>Other things there be in theſe Synchroniſms, which for brevity ſake I omit to ſpeak unto. By that which hath been ſaid the Reader may perceive there be no ſuch Synchroniſms as he would have, except thoſe which belong to one and the ſame Prophecy; as the two <hi>Beaſts</hi> in the thirteenth Chapter do: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the Prophecies ſucceed one another, and ſhall come to paſs in order (not as they be written) but as they were reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and this is a ſure rule to go by, and gives great Light to the Expoſition of the Prophecies; for ſuch an Expoſition muſt be put on each Prophecy, as to make it ſucceed the Prophecy that went before, and precede the Prophecie which follows af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the ſame order to be obſerved in Execution, as was in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</p>
                     <p>And here the Reader may take notice. 1. That every one of theſe Synchroniſms is to be underſtood of a total, not of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Contemporation; for ſome of them are true of a partial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporation, (as that the ſealed Virgins do contemporate with the <hi>Beaſt</hi>) but none of them of a total. 2. That for the moſt part things are ſet down in writing, in ſuch order as they were revealed; and there be but very few things that be ſet down o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, and they be ſuch as belong to one and the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and were preſented to <hi>John</hi> both together, but could not be ſet down in writing both together, but immediately one after another: As for inſtance, the Travel of the Woman with Child, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. and the watching of the Dragon to devour her Child as ſoon as it was born, were preſented unto <hi>John</hi> both together, and ſhall come to paſs both together; but he could not ſet them down in writing both together, but immediately one after another: So the watching of the Dragon, and the Battail of <hi>Michael,</hi> with him, were preſented to <hi>John</hi> both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſhall come to paſs both together, but could not be ſet down in writing both together (but immediately one after another) unleſs it were in Colums in this manner.</p>

                     <p>Unleſs it be in this manner, theſe things could not be ſet down in writing together, but one behind another; and in ſuch a caſe as this, things are not ſet down in writing in ſome places, in ſuch order as they were revealed, and they are ſuch as belong to one and the ſame Prophecy; but in other caſes, where Prophecies are diſtinct one from another, and concern different matters, they are ſet down in writing in ſuch order as they were revealed, and ſhall come to paſs in the ſame order as they were revealed; not any thing of another nature, or belonging to another Prophecy coming between.

                  <p n="3">3. Look into the former Trumpet, and you ſhall not find any thing interpoſed between the end of that Trumpet, and the cloſe thereof; and why ſhould any Man think that ſo large a Prophecy, as is contained between the ſeventh Verſe of the tenth Chapter, and the fourteenth Verſe of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Chapter, is interpoſed here?</p>

                     <hi>when he ſhall be ready to ſound,</hi> Quando futurum eſt ut clangat, ſaith Brightman, <hi>when his turn ſhall come to ſound;</hi> which plainly ſhews, that the time for the ſeventh Trumpet was not yet come to ſound, and that the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:180584:67"/>time of the ſixth Trumpet was not yet expired, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue longer, even to the fourteenth verſe of the eleventh Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter.</p>
                  <p>Ob. <hi>The Prophecy of the little Book is no part of the ſixth Trumpet, but the Prophecy of this eleventh Chapter, from the firſt verſe to the fourteenth doth belong unto the little Book, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I deny the Major, for a little Book may be the iſſue or Daughter of a great Book, and as out of the ſeventh Seal came forth ſeven Trumpets, ſo out of the ſixth Trumpet came forth the little Book, whether any thing were written therein or no, and if there were, it doth belong unto the ſixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and to no other. 2. I deny the minor, for the little Book had not any Prophecy written in it, as hath been ſhewed in the former Chapter; and when the Angel ſaid to <hi>John</hi> in the former Chapter, <hi>Thou muſt Prophecy again,</hi> his meaning is not that he muſt begin a new Prophecy, <hi>ab ovo,</hi> and ſo begin a new Book, repeating the ſame times over again, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> would have it, <hi>clavis Apoc. p.</hi> 13. <hi>Remàines p.</hi> 4, 5. but his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that he muſt go forward with the former Prophecy of the Seals and Trumpets, and in particular, with the Prophecy of the ſixth Trumpet, and make known the other part thereof which was yet behind.</p>
                  <p>Ob. <hi>By</hi> 42 <hi>months mentioned ver.</hi> 2. <hi>is meant Prophetical months, and by</hi> 1260 <hi>days ver.</hi> 3. <hi>is meant Prophetical days, that is</hi> 1260 <hi>years, as appears Numb.</hi> 14.34. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 4.6. <hi>but it is not likely that the ſixth Trumpet ſhould continue half ſo long.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Look into the Prophets he that will, he ſhall never find a Prophetical month any more than a natural month, and that is thirty natural days, and no more; and as for the word <hi>dayes,</hi> it is very ſeldom, if ever at all put for years, unleſs it be typically, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.34. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 4.6. but
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:180584:67"/>not elſewhere. 2. What if <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.34. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 4.6. a day be put for a year? Is it therefore ſo here? Or is it ſo in all other Prophecies of the Scripture beſide? If it were, it is very likely it ſhould be ſo here; but look into the Prophets while you will, you ſhall hardly find it taken for a year in other places, therefore not likely it ſhould be ſo taken in the <hi>Revelation.</hi> 3. Is the ſame number, or the ſame matter ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.34. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 4.6. as is here? If it were, no doubt they ſhould be taken all alike in all the three places; but compare the words together, you ſhall not find the ſame number, nor the ſame matter ſpoken of <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.34. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 4.6. as is here. 4. What if I ſhould ſhew you a Text of Scripture, where the ſelf ſame number that is here uſed, is taken literally for 1260 natural days, and no more? Is not this a more probable Argument, that it is ſo taken here? Look then into the next Chapter following, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. and ask Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> himſelf, and others of our Proteſtant Divines, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 1260 days be any more than three years and a half, <hi>Comment Apoc. pag.</hi> 174. <hi>Moulins</hi> Accompliſhment of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, <hi>pag.</hi> 194. 200, 201. <hi>Piſcator</hi> in <hi>Apoc. cap.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 6. and then judge of it. 5. What if <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.34. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4.6. days be not put for years abſolutely, but typically? Read the words, and you ſhall find that to be the meaning. <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the number of the days in which ye ſearched the Land, even</hi> 40 <hi>days, each day for a year ſhall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years:</hi> be not days here, types of years? So again, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 4.5, 6. <hi>According to the number of the days, 390 days, ſo ſhalt thou bear the iniquity of the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael. <hi>And when thou haſt accompliſhed them, lye again on thy right ſide, and thou ſhalt bear the iniquity of the Houſe of</hi> Juda 40 <hi>days, I have appointed thee each day for a year:</hi> is not this typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to be underſtood? And if days be not put for years in neither of theſe places unleſs it be typically, why ſhould any
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:180584:68"/>man think that in the <hi>Revelation</hi> they be put for years abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely? For typically they cannot be, unleſs a man will ſay, that <hi>John</hi> was three years and a half in receiving this Prophecy, as the men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were forty days in ſearching the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which I think no man will affirm. Briefly then, if days be put for years in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> 1260 days for 1260 years, it is either abſolutely, or typically. If abſolutely, ſhew me the like in other places: If typically, ſhew me the analogy between the type, and the Antitype, as it is plainly to be ſeen in <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> As ye were forty days in ſearching the Land, ſo ſhall ye bear your iniquity in the Wilderneſs forty years; and as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was to lye on his right ſide forty days, ſo God would wink at their iniquity forty years, and then the captivity ſhould be brought upon them. This is the analogy beteen the type, and the Antitype, in <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> ſhew me the analogy in the <hi>Revelation;</hi> for if no analogy can be found, there is no type, nor Antitype to be had. Again, if days be put for years abſolutely in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> then neither that place, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.34. nor that place, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4.6. will prove it, for in both theſe places, they be put typically, not abſolutely. And if it be ſaid, that they be put typically in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> then as <hi>Ezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> was to lye on his right ſide forty days in his ecſtaſie, ſo the Angel was three years and a half in revealing this Prophecy unto <hi>John,</hi> and three years and a half more in revealing the Prophecy of the <hi>Woman,</hi> and three years and a half more in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing the Prophecy of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> was ſo long in his ecſtaſie, when as the whole <hi>Revelation</hi> was revealed to him in one day, and that was the Lords day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. See <hi>Diſp.</hi> 1. <hi>q.</hi> 2.6. What if theſe 1260 days of the Witneſſes, and the 1260 days of the Womans living in the Wilderneſs, and the 42 months of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> do not contemporate, but ſucceed one another? Is not this an Argument that they are literally to be underſtood? Now that the 42 months of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> ſhall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:180584:68"/>the 1260 days of the <hi>Woman,</hi> and the 1260 days of the woman ſhall ſucced the 1260 days of the Witneſſes, hath been proved already in the former Chapter, <hi>q.</hi> 2. and ſhall be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed farther in the twelfth and thirteenth Chapters following. 7. What if theſe days of the Witneſſes be days of ſafety and ſecurity, is it likely that they ſhall be in ſafety or ſecurity ſo many years? Now that theſe days of the Witneſſes be days of ſafety and ſecurity, the fifth, ſixth, and ſeventh verſes of this Chapter do plainly teach, <hi>And if any man will hurt them,</hi> (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand before the 1260 days be ended) <hi>fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their Enemies,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be in danger all that time, but the Witneſſes be in ſafety. 8. To this may be added what the Angel ſaith in the former Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7. that <hi>there ſhould be time no longer, but in the days of the voice of the ſeventh Angel when he ſhall begin to ſound, the myſtery of God ſhall be finiſhed,</hi> which words imply that there is but a very little time from thence to the ſounding of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Trumpet, as <hi>Brightman</hi> well expounds it, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the 1260 days of the two Witneſſes which comes between that time, and the ſounding of that Trumpet, is but a ſhort time. To which likewiſe may be added that theſe two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes be two men, and no more, and therefore they cannot live ſo long as to Propheſie 1260 years. And if it be ſaid that theſe two Witneſſes be put for all the Prophets that ſuffered for the name of Chriſt all that time, and that they be called two becauſe they be but few, to this I anſwer. 1. That if this were the meaning, the word [two] might very well have been left out, and it had been ſufficient to have ſaid, <hi>I will give power to my Witneſſes, and they ſhall Propheſie</hi> 1260 <hi>days,</hi> and this would have took them in all, and the ſenſe had been compleat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the word [two,] but the wiſdom of God thought it fit to put it in, and that no leſs than four times in this Prophecy, once <hi>v.</hi> 3. twice <hi>v.</hi> 4. and the fourth time <hi>v.</hi> 10. and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:180584:69"/>was it done but to ſhew that theſe two Witneſſes be two men, and no more, like as when 'tis ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.38. <hi>And there were two Thieves crucified with him,</hi> wherefore was the word [two] put in, but to ſhew the Thieves were two men, and no more? So when 'tis ſaid, <hi>I will give power to my two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> wherefore is the word [two] put in, but to ſhew that theſe two Witneſſes be two men, and no more? 2. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay that all the Prophets which ſuffered for the name of Chriſt in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days were but few, or that they which ſuffered ſince in <hi>Ireland</hi> were but few, or that they which ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of late days in <hi>Savoy,</hi> were but few; much leſs can we ſay that all the Prophets which ſuffered in 1260 years ſpace, were but few. And though the Prophets which ſuffered in ſome Kings Reigns were but few, or none at all, yet count we the number of them all which ſuffered in 1260 years ſpace, and we cannot ſay that they be few.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.9.14.</note> 3. We cannot ſay that all the Prophets which ſuffered for the name of Chriſt in 1260 years ſpace (call them few or many) did begin and end their Prophecy together, but ſome at one time, and ſome at another time. We cannot ſay that they did all dye in one day, and in one place, but ſome in one year, and ſome in another year, ſome in one place, and ſome in another place: but of theſe two Witneſſes we may ſay, that they did both begin and end their Prophecy together, they both ſuffer death in one day, and in one place, and they both return to life in one hour. And therefore theſe two witneſſes be not all the Prophets of the Lord which have ſuffered for his name 1260 years together, for they dyed ſucceſſively at diſtant times, and in diſtant places, but theſe died both in one day, and in one place too, and therefore they be two men, and no more, and the 1260 days be three years and a half, and no more. And this is more than I need have ſaid to this objection, but if any doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire more, let him read what is ſaid <hi>ch.</hi> 12. <hi>q.</hi> 2. and he ſhall find ſomething more ſaid unto it.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 Queſt. <hi>Whether this Prophecy were fulfilled in</hi> Adrians <hi>time?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The meaſuring of a Temple and an Altar, doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the building of two Holy places at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for the People of the <hi>Jews</hi> to worſhip in, the one in the place where the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſtood, the other in the place where the Altar ſtood, but we read not of any ſuch places built in <hi>Adrians</hi> time, but we read in ſome Books of Hiſtory, that <hi>Adrian</hi> would have built a Church for <hi>Chriſtians</hi> without Images, if ſome about him had not told him that it would be diſhonourable to all the reſt of the Gods, which was the cauſe he did it not. See <hi>Prideaux Hiſtory,</hi> pag. 199.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The not meaſuring of the <hi>Court which is without the Temple</hi> doth imply the not building of it, therefore the building of a new City at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Adrian</hi> in the place where the outer Court did ſtand, cannot be meant thereby.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. After the building of the Temple, and the Altar, the outer Court ſhall be given to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the Holy City ſhall they tread under Foot 42 months after the Holy places be provided, and no longer: but ſince the time of <hi>Adrian</hi> to this day has been more than 42 months which way ſoever we take them, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> has been troden under foot by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> all this while.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The two Witneſſes be not two Biſhops at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the one of the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> the other of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Congregations, for there was but one Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at one time, and there were but fifteen Biſhops in all, until the deſtruction of the <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Adrian,</hi> and all of them were <hi>Jews,</hi> whereof the firſt was <hi>James</hi> the Brother of the Lord, and the laſt was <hi>Judas;</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the City was deſtroyed by him, there were no more Biſhops of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the firſt of them was <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus.</hi> See <hi>Euſebius l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The two witneſſes be Prophets extraordinary, as appears
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:180584:70"/>by their deſcription, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4. and by their miracles, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. now there were no Prophets extraordinary in the days of <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and there were not any that could do ſuch miracles as theſe had power to do <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. in <hi>Adrians</hi> time, nor in any time ſince.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. When the two Witneſſes ſhall have <hi>finiſhed their teſtimony, the Beaſt that cometh out of the bottomleſs Pit, ſhall make War againſt them, and overcome them, and ſlay them,</hi> v. 7. Now there was no <hi>Beaſt</hi> in <hi>Adrians</hi> time, except <hi>Adrian</hi> himſelf, and he did not make War againſt the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in <hi>Judaea,</hi> but againſt the wicked and Rebellious <hi>Jews</hi> only: but they with whom I deal in this queſtion, will not allow <hi>Adrian</hi> to be the <hi>Beaſt</hi> here ſpoken of, but one <hi>Barchocheba</hi> a Rebellious Captain of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Adrians</hi> time. Now by the <hi>Beaſt</hi> is meant ſome po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent King or other that had ten Kings under him, or to joyn with him, as appears <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.12, 13.17. but <hi>Barchocheba</hi> was no King, nor had any King under him, or to joyn with him.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. After the two Witneſſes had been dead three days and a half, <hi>the Spirit of life from God entred into them, and they ſtood upon their feet,</hi> v. 11. but there were not any that were raiſed from death to life in the days of <hi>Adrian,</hi> nor in any time ſince. And if it be ſaid, that this is meant of their ſucceſſours, to this I anſwer. 1. That the two Witneſſes had no ſucceſſours, for there were no ſuch Prophets in <hi>Adrians</hi> time, nor at any time ſince, and there were not any that could do ſuch miracles as theſe had power to do <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. in <hi>Adrians time,</hi> nor in any time ſince. 2. The ſouls of men after they be dead, do not enter into other mens bodies, but into their own bodies, only now 'tis ſaid, <hi>the Spirit of life,</hi> (that is their Souls) <hi>entred into them,</hi> v. 11. therefore this is not meant of their ſucceſſours, but of their own bodies; for if the Spirit of life did enter into their ſucceſſours, it did not enter into them, but into others,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:180584:70"/>and they did not ſtand upon their feet, that is their own feet, but upon the feet of others. 3. <hi>They heard a voice from Heaven ſaying unto them, Come up hither; and they aſcended up to Heaven in a Cloud, and their enemies beheld them,</hi> v. 12. Now, what man did ever aſcend to Heaven in ſucceſſours? And what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit were it to him if he did? We read that <hi>Chriſt</hi> aſcended thither, and ſo did <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias;</hi> but of any that went to Heaven in ſucceſſours, we read not in all the Scripture. And if theſe two Witneſſes did aſcend to Heaven, as were made alive in ſucceſſours, what became of their dead bodies? The Text ſaith, <hi>they ſhall lye in the ſtreet of the great City, and they ſhall ſee their dead bodies three days and a half, and ſhall not ſuffer their dead bodies to be put in Graves,</hi> v. 8, 9. but if the Spirit of life did not enter into them, what became of their dead bodies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward? Did they lye in the ſtreet ſtill? Or did the Ravens eat them, or the Dogs devour them, or were they buried in the earth-quake? Or what became of them, let them tell me if they can? And let them tell me too, whether <hi>Barchocheba</hi> and his complices, whom they ſuppoſe to be the enemies of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes here ſpoken of, were not dead before the Chriſtians in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drians</hi> time were advanced to peace, and Halcyonian days in <hi>Iudaea?</hi> And if they were, how can it be ſaid that their enemies did behold their aſcenſion into Heaven, ſeeing they were dead before? And laſtly, if the Witneſſes were made alive in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours, why do they not alſo ſay that the Widows Son of <hi>Naim</hi> was made alive in a ſucceſſour? And if they aſcended up to Heaven in ſucceſſours, why do they not alſo ſay that <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> aſcended thither in ſucceſſours? Yea, why do they not ſay that <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf aſcended thither in a ſucceſſour? And why do they not ſay that all the Texts of Scripture which ſpeak of the Reſurrection of the dead, be meant of the riſing of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours? And if they can have Faith to believe that the Texts of Scripture which ſpeak of the Reſurrection of the dead, be
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:180584:71"/>meant of the Reſurrection of the ſame bodies that were dead, why can they not have ſo much Faith as a grain of Muſtard Seed, to believe that the enlivening of the Witneſſes, is meant of the enlivening of the ſame bodies that were dead?</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>The ſame hour</hi> that this was done, <hi>there was a great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,</hi> v. 13. but we read not of any earth-quake at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> in <hi>Adrians</hi> time, but in <hi>Iulians</hi> time there was.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>The tenth part of the City fell,</hi> v. 13.

But that which makes men run into theſe errors, is partly becauſe they turn the literal ſenſe into a myſtical, and partly becauſe they make a Hiſtory of that which is yet a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and ſeek for things future in ages paſt, where they ſhall never find them.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If this be a Prophecy of what was done in <hi>Adrians</hi> time, what's the reaſon we have not a Prophecy of what was done in <hi>Iulians</hi> time? For remarkable things were done in his time, and there was not a total deſtruction of the Temple un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till then, at which time there was ſuch an earth-quake at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> that the very Foundations of the Temple were deſtroyed
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:180584:71"/>thereby, which was not done before. Yea, what's the reaſon we have no Prophecy of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> who have tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> under foot many hundred years, and not only it, but all the Churches in the Eaſt beſide, is not this more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable than what was done in <hi>Adrians</hi> time, or in <hi>Iulians</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? And is it likely that ſo many Prophecies ſhould be ſpent about the affairs of <hi>Iudaea</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and not a word of this? Is not this an indication that the Prophecies have ſome other meaning? And that this Prophecy of the two Witneſſes was not fulfilled in <hi>Adrians</hi> time, but is yet to be expected?</p>

And where ſhall this be done, but at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> where the <hi>Iews</hi> dwell, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:180584:72"/>in the Temple, and the Altar that is the inner Court, which is to be provided for this end and purpoſe that the Witneſſes may Propheſie therein.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Look into the Hiſtory of their return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and you ſhall find they began their reſtauration with the building of the Temple, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.22, 23. <hi>Ezra</hi> 1.1, 2, 3. they did not build their own Houſes firſt, (as men have done in our days,) and the Temple afterward, but they built the Temple firſt, and their own Houſes afterward: and no other courſe do they take here; we read not of the building of their own Houſes in this place, but of the building of a Temple, and an Altar at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to worſhip God in, and no more.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Look into the Prophet <hi>Zachary,</hi> and you ſhall find that the Viſion of a <hi>Candleſtick,</hi> and of two <hi>Olive Trees</hi> is preſented to the Prophet, to ſignifie unto him the building of the Temple at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and reſtoring the worſhip of God to that Nation, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for no other reaſon are theſe two Witneſſes called two Olives, and two Candleſticks, than that they reſtore the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God in ſome meaſure to the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Nation.</p>
                  <p n="6">6.

                  <p n="7">7.

                  <p n="8">8. The place where this is to be done is <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and therefore that people are concerned in this Prophecy; and the thing that is aimed at by the two Witneſſes, is the converſion of that Nation, &amp; what is here done by them, is a tendency or preparation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and not only the <hi>Jews</hi> which are then dwelling at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſhall come unto them and hear them preach, but other <hi>Jews</hi> alſo which dwell in other Countries hearing what is done at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> &amp; what ſucceſs the Witneſſes have there, will reſort thither, hoping to ſee their Reſtauration brought to paſs at this time, or to learn of them what they ſhould do in order to their Reſtaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                  <p>Object. <hi>By the meaſuring of the</hi> Temple <hi>and the</hi> Altar, <hi>is meant a ſpiritual Building, and not a material.</hi>

                  <p>Object. <hi>By</hi> Altar <hi>is not meant a material</hi> Altar, <hi>but a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; for no ſuch</hi> Altars <hi>are to be made in the time of the Goſpel.</hi>

One and the ſame place is called <hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Bethaven</hi> in the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.5, 15. ſo is <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> called a faithful City, and a Harlot too in one and the ſame Prophecy, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1.21.

And therefore no marvel if a Holy City be made unholy, and yet retain the Name of Holy from its firſt Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 3. The reaſon why <hi>Bethel</hi> was called <hi>Bethaven,</hi> is becauſe it was the place of Idol Worſhip, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.29. and the reaſon why it retained the Name of <hi>Bethel</hi> ſtill, is becauſe it was the ancient place of Gods Worſhip, before the Idol Worſhip came thither, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.17, 19. <hi>Iud.</hi> 2.18. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.3. So the reaſon why <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> is called <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> at this time, is becauſe the <hi>Gentiles</hi> which are in it at this time are as unclean as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and as cruel to the people of God as <hi>Egypt</hi> was heretofore; and the reaſon why it retains the Name of the Holy City ſtill, is becauſe it was the ancient place of God's Worſhip before the <hi>Sodomites</hi> came thither, and ſhall be ſo again when the <hi>Sodomites</hi> are gone from thence, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.20. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 2.2, 3.

Let it be ſuppoſed that the word <hi>(where)</hi> has reference to the word <hi>(ſtreet)</hi> and that it ſignifies as much as <hi>(in which)</hi> yet this will do them no good; for part of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> doth now ſtand on Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> at this day, and what may be hereafter when this Prophecy comes to be fulfilled, who can tell?</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>Chriſt was crucified at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and in the</hi> Roman Empire <hi>too.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> What then? The firſt is meant in this place, and not the laſt; for Chriſt was not crucified all the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> over, but in one only place thereof, and that was at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and no where elſe. 2. If a man ſhould ask of theſe men where our Saviour Chriſt was born, they would not anſwer at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and in the <hi>Roman-Empire</hi> too? For they know very well, that the Queſtion is not meant of the place in general, but of the place in particular; ſo when 'tis ſaid <hi>(where our Lord was crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)</hi> it is not meant of the place in general, but of the place in particular, and the general is included in the particular, and is ſufficiently known by naming the particular; ſo that they need not ſay at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and in the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> too, for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is included in the former, and is ſufficiently known by naming of the former, unleſs there had been two <hi>Ieruſalems</hi> in the World, one in the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and the other without, as there were two <hi>Bethlehems</hi> heretofore, one in <hi>Iudea,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in <hi>Galilee,</hi> which is the cauſe that the Goſpel ſaith, in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> of <hi>Iudea,</hi> Mat. 2.1. to diſtinguiſh it from the other <hi>Bethlehem</hi> which was in <hi>Galilee:</hi> So if there had been two <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalems</hi>

                  <p>Ob. <hi>Chriſt was crucified by the authority of the City of</hi> Rome, <hi>and in that reſpect may be ſaid to be crucified at</hi> Rome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I deny the ſequele. For Chriſt told <hi>Pilate, thou couldeſt have no power at all againſt me, except it were given thee from above,</hi> Joh. 19.11. yet no man will conclude from thence, that Chriſt was crucified in Heaven, becauſe <hi>Pilate</hi> had authority from Heaven; no more ought any man to ſay that Chriſt was crucified at <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe <hi>Pilate</hi> had authority from thence. <hi>Herod</hi> had authority from the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet the young children which were ſlain by him, were ſlain at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and not at <hi>Rome, Mat.</hi> 2.16. Yea, we may go a little farther and ſay that the City of <hi>Rome</hi> was not guilty of their death, nor of Chriſts neither, for the authority which <hi>Herod</hi> had, was only in the general, and that is not ſufficient to make the City of <hi>Rome</hi> guilty of their blood, it muſt be a ſpecial warrant, order or authority from <hi>Rome</hi> that muſt do that, and this <hi>Herod</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo did <hi>Pilate</hi> too. Yea, let us go a little farther, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that <hi>Pilate</hi> had a ſpecial order or authority from the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> to put our Saviour Chriſt to death, yet this will not ſuffice to make the (<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>) the <hi>(ubi)</hi> and the <hi>(where)</hi> do note the place where the thing was done, and not the power or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by which 'twas done: as when 'tis ſaid that <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of <hi>Ioſes</hi> beheld <hi>where</hi> here he was laid, <hi>Mark</hi> 15.47. it is not meant of the power or authority, which
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:180584:75"/>they had from <hi>Pilate</hi> to lay his body there, but of the place where they laid him. And ſo give inſtance where you will, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fails. See <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.18.20.41.</p>
                  <p>Ob. <hi>Chriſt was crucified not only by the</hi> Roman power, <hi>but alſo for the</hi> Roman cauſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It was a pretended cauſe, and not a real, for <hi>Pilate</hi> did acquit him, and ſaid he found no fault in him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.4. and the reaſon why he put <hi>Jeſus</hi> to death, was for fear of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and not for any other cauſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.27. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.22, 23. But ſecondly, let the cauſe be what it will, it is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for the cauſe is not here ſpoken of, but the place only, and they which underſtand the (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) the <hi>(ubi)</hi> or the <hi>(where) our Lord was crucified</hi> to be meant of the cauſe, and not of the place, are as far from the meaning of the Prophecy as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is from <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ob. <hi>Chriſt was been crucified in his members at</hi> Babylon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Is this indeed the meaning? Why, Chriſt has been cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in his members at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as well as in his own body, ſo that <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> may be the City in that ſenſe too. 2. I deny that to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> meaning, for it is not ſaid in every City, <hi>where our Lord was crucified,</hi> but <hi>in the ſtreet of the great City,</hi> pointing out but one City, and no more. 3. Theſe words <hi>(where our Lord was crucified)</hi> were added to deelare what City 'tis where the Witneſſes ſhall be ſlain; and if we underſtand them of the City where Chriſt was crucified himſelf, we can quickly tell what City 'tis that is meant in this place; but if we underſtand it of the crucifixion of his members from time to time, Chriſt has been crucified in ſo many places, that we cannot tell by this deſcription, what City 'tis is meant here. 4. Who be the members in which you ſay Chriſt was crucified? Be they the ſame with the two Witneſſes? Or be they other members of his? If other members, then unleſs you tell us who theſe other members be, we cannot tell by this anſwer what the City is, in
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:180584:75"/>which the two Witneſſes ſhall be ſlain. But if you ſay the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers be the ſame with the two Witneſſes, what is this but a meer Tautology? It amounts to no more than this, the two Witneſſes ſhall be ſlain in the City where they ſhall be ſlain.</p>
                  <p>That which makes men run into theſe errors, and miſtake the meaning of the Prophecy, is becauſe they put no difference between the ſeat of the Witneſſes, and the ſeat of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> in which reſpect the Proteſtants are as far remote from the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Prophecy, as the Papiſts; for the Papiſts make the ſeat of the Witneſſes to be <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and the ſame the ſeat of the Beaſt too, but the Proteſtants make <hi>Babylon</hi> the ſeat of both. And both of them are out in this particular, for <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> is the ſeat of the Witneſſes, but not of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> is the ſeat of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> but not of the Witneſſes: and it is altogether unlikely, and inconſonant to reaſon that the Witneſſes ſhould Propheſie in <hi>Babylon</hi> where the Beaſt hath his Throne, or that the <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſhould let them Propheſie before his own door three years and a half before the War againſt them. But it is very likely and conſonant to reaſon that the Witneſſes ſhould Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſome hundred miles diſtant from the City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> for ſome ſpace of time before the <hi>Beaſt</hi> hear thereof; and it is alſo likely, that as ſoon as he doth hear thereof he will ſend his Soldiers forth of <hi>Babylon</hi> to march unto <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to War againſt the Witneſſes, and put an end unto their Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying, which Soldiers of his may come thither at that nick of time, in which the three years and a half allotted for their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying ſhall be ended. So that the Witneſſes are not ſlain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſs of that time, or before that time be ended, as ſome would have it, but immediately when that time is over. This is my conception of this Prophecy, which I ſhall adhere unto until a better ſhall be ſhewn me. And here the Reader may perceive, that I follow neither Papiſt nor Proteſtant in the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:180584:76"/>of this Prophecy, but the truth only, which if it pleaſe God to diſcover by my weak endeavours, it is as much as I look after in writing what I do.</p>

                  <head>The Prophecy of the Woman and the great Red Dragon, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the converſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the oppoſition and perſecution of the Devil.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. AND I ſaw a great wonder in the Starry Heaven, prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guring what ſhould be done upon the earth, and the wonder which I ſaw, was a woman repreſenting the Nation of the <hi>Iews,</hi> cloathed with the Sun, in token of her future Glory, and the Moon beneath her Feet in token ſhe ſhould change no more,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.9, 10.</note> and a Crown of twelve Stars upon her head, which are the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:180584:76"/>
                  <p n="2">2. And their converſion ſhall be like the pains of a woman in Travel, which hath hard labour, and ſtrong pains, and throws before ſhe be delivered; even ſo they of this Nation that be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted firſt, ſhall have hard labour, and Travel to convert the reſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And I ſaw another wonder in the Starry Heaven, and it was a great Red Dragon repreſenting the Devil, and his mighty Agents upon earth, which ſhall oppoſe the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in her Travel, and hinder their converſion what they can, and they be ſeven Heathen Kings, which ſhall have Crowns upon their Heads, and ten Heathen Kingdoms which ſhall have no Kings of their own in them at this time.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And he ſhall be in a great rage to hear of the converſion of this Church and Nation, and in this rage of his ſhall with his tail (in which as ſome ſay his main ſtrength doth lye) ſeek to overthrow the frame of nature, and had rather Heaven and Earth ſhould have an end, than the converſion of that Church be brought to paſs. Or elſe his tail may repreſent the vulgar people that be in his Kingdoms, as his ſeven heads do repreſent his Kings, and by the help of this vulgar people, he ſhall turn aſide ſome part of that Nation from minding their converſion at the preſent, and draw their hearts away from Heavenly things to earthly, or elſe do ſome other hurt unto them, and he himſelf ſhall ſtand before the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> now ready to be converted to the Faith of Chriſt, threatning to devour them and their Children ſo ſoon as they become Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Yet for all this they ſhall be converted to the Chriſtian Faith, and the Child that ſhall be born of them is Jeſus Chriſt, who is then ſaid to be born ſpiritually, whenas a Church or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is brought to believe in him, and after their converſion he ſhall ſubdue all Nations that War againſt them with the Sword,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:180584:77"/>but he himſelf ſhall ſit in Heaven at Gods right hand, and on his Throne.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And when they be converted, a great part of that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall flee into the Wilderneſs, eſpecially they that be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to convert the reſt, where they ſhall have a place pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them by the Lord their God, as their forefathers had,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.14, 15.</note> when they came forth of <hi>Egypt</hi> that they may be nouriſhed, and preſerved there three years and a half, from the fury of the Devil and his Agents.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But before that this is done, there ſhall be a great battel in the Church, <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels ſhall fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Devil in behalf of the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.13.21. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.1.</note> that they may be converted to the Chriſtian Faith, and the Devil ſhall fight againſt <hi>Michael,</hi> and his Angels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the others Angels, that they may remain in unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. But <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels ſhall prevail, and the Devil and his Angels ſhall be overthrown, and there ſhall be no place for them any more in the Church of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. And the great Red Dragon, that old malicious Serpent, otherwiſe called the Devil and Satan, who deceived our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents at the firſt and the whole race of mankind ever ſince, ſhall be caſt forth of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, and all his evil Angels caſt forth with him.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And there ſhall be great joy in the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and loud acclamation and Thankſgiving, ſaying, Now is ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion come to the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the Lord our God, he is the Author of it, and to him be it aſcribed for evermore. And the might and Kingdom of our God ſhall now be ſeen and made known unto the World, and the power of his Chriſt, for the accuſer of that Church and Nation is caſt forth, who before their converſion, accuſed them of their unbelief before our God, day
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:180584:77"/>and night, but from henceforth ſhall accuſe them of that crime no more.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. But they ſhall overcome him by the merits of his blood, who died for them, and by their Faith which they have in him, and the open profeſſion of the ſame, and they ſhall not love their lives more than they love their Chriſt, but expoſe them unto death, rather than remain in unbelief, and deny their Faith in him, and for this it is that Satan ſhall be caſt forth of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Rejoyce ye Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> becauſe Satan is caſt forth of your Nation, and from ruling any more therein, but wo be to the unbelieving Gentiles after this is done, for the Devil will be among you altogether, and have great wrath, as knowing he hath but a ſhort time to ſtay among you.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And when Satan ſhall perceive that he is caſt forth of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, he ſhall ſet himſelf to perſecute that Church and Nation, eſpecially thoſe members of them which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted firſt, and ſhall be inſtrumental to beget the reſt to the Faith of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. But power and opportunity ſhall be given to thoſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Church, to fly into the Wilderneſs, to the place prepared for them, where they ſhall be nouriſhed and preſerved three years and a half from the power of the Devil and his Angels.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. And when the Devil ſhall perceive that they are fled into the Wilderneſs, he ſhall ſend a flood of Water after them, to drown them in the Wilderneſs, or drive them out from thence.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. But God ſhall cauſe the dry and thirſty earth to open her mouth, and ſwallow up the flood of Water which the Devil ſhall ſend after them, and the Water thereupon ſhall do them no hurt.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. At which the Devil ſhall be very wroth, and thereupon
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:180584:78"/>ſhall leave the Wilderneſs where they be, and make War with the remnant of that Church and Nation which ſhall not flee into the Wilderneſs as the other ſhall, but keep the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord their God, and profeſs the faith of Jeſus Chriſt in their known and open dwellings.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. And to accompliſh this deſign of his, he ſhall ſtand upon the ſea ſhore, repreſenting the heathen people and Nations of the World, out of whom he ſhall raiſe a beaſtly Tyrant to make War againſt that part of the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> which ſhall flee into the Wilderneſs as hereafter followeth.</p>

               <div n="8" type="disputation">
                  <head>Diſputation VIII.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Queſt. <hi>Whether this Prophecy doth belong to the ſeventh Trumpet, and be a part thereof?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The ſeventh Trumpet doth not end with the former Chapter, but reacheth onward to the end of the Book; and whereas the other Trumpets have a cloſe added to them, this Trumpet hath no cloſe at all, and therefore hath no end at all before the Book be ended. You will ſay the four firſt Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets have no cloſe to them. <hi>Anſw.</hi> They had other Trumpets to ſucceed them, but this Trumpet is the laſt of all, and hath no Trumpet to ſucceed it. Again the two firſt Woe Trumpets had a cloſe ſet unto them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.14. But this Trumpet is the third Woe Trumpet, and therefore ſhould in all likely-hood have a cloſe ſet unto it as the other have, if there were any to be ſet.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Prophecy doth not belong to the little Book, but to the Book ſealed with ſeven Seals, for that Book had ſomething written in it, but the little Book had nothing written in it, now there is no part of that Book to which this Prophecy can belong but to the ſeventh Trumpet only.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Prophecy of the ſeven Vials doth belong unto the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:180584:78"/>ſeventh Trumpet, therefore that which comes between the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſeventh Trumpet, and the ſeven Vials doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the ſeventh Trumpet alſo. Now that the ſeven Vials do belong to the ſeventh Trumpet may appear from hence, that as the ſeventh Seal doth contain ſeven Trumpets, ſo the ſeventh Trumpet by the like proportion doth contain ſeven Vials, and Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> in his Remains, pag. 10. doth implicitly confeſs this Argument to be good, in caſe there be but one Book of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and this I have already proved in a ſelect queſtion on the tenth Chapter concerning this ſubject.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The myſtery of God doth belong unto the ſeventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, as the Angel plainly ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.7. but the parturiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Woman is the myſtery of God there ſpoken of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25.</p>
                  <p>Ob. <hi>In the former Chapter,</hi> v. 15.17, 18. <hi>there is mention of the Kingdom of Chriſt, and of the time of the dead that they ſhould be judged, and ſhall this Prophecy ſucceed that?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> No, it ſhall not ſucceed it but begin it. The converſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> is the inchoation of the Kingdom there ſpoken of as appears v. 10. and the time of the dead in which they ſhall be judged or avenged, ſhall follow thereupon as appears v. 12. but more particularly ch. 14. 7. 13. 15, 16. ch. 15. 1. ch. 16. throughout, ch. 18. 6. 20. 24. ch. 19. 2. 20, 21. all which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto the ſeventh Trumpet, and is the execution of what was ſpoken of in general in the former Chapter, in which the ſeventh Trumpet is ſet down in groſs, but in this and the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters following at retail. To which may be added that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Trumpet is a Woe Trumpet, and there be no Woes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that Trumpet in the former Chapter, but only in the general, therefore the particulars are in the Chapters fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Queſt. <hi>Whether this Prophecy doth contemporate with the Prophecy of the two witneſſes, or ſucceed it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:180584:79"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The ſeventh Trumpet doth ſucceed the ſixth, but this Prophecy belongs to the ſeventh Trumpet, and that of the two witneſſes to the ſixth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That which gave occaſion or an opportunity to the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Temple, and the prophecying of the witneſſes, and removed the impediment thereof, was the ſlaughter of the third part of men which were dwelling at <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and that which gives occaſion or an opportunity to the parturition of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and removeth the impediment thereof, is the fall of the tenth part of the City, and the judgment on the <hi>Beaſt, Rev.</hi> 11.13. and as the ſlaughter of the third part of Men which were dwelling at <hi>Euphrates,</hi> goes before the prophecying on the witneſſes, as being the occaſion of it by removing the impediments,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.6, 7.</note> and affording an opportunity thereunto, ſo the fall of the City, and the judgment on the <hi>Beaſt</hi> goes before the Travail of the Woman, as being the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of it, by removing the impediments, which were or might be a hindrance to it, and affording an opportunity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, whereby it might be brought to paſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Church in building is before the Church builded, but during the prophecying of the witneſſes, the Church is in building, and when the Woman has brought forth her child, the Church is then built.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Perſecution and freedom from it cannot contemporate each with other, but in the time of this Prophecy, the Church is under perſecution, and during the prophecying of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, the Church is free therefrom until the 1260 days be ended, and then the <hi>Beaſt</hi> doth war againſt the witneſſes, but not before, and though the outer Court be given to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> during the prophecying of the witneſſes, yet the inner court where the Church is, they dare not meddle with.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Good ſucceſs, and bad ſucceſs cannot contemporate each with other, but in the former Prophecy the enemy hath ſome
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:180584:79"/>ſucceſs againſt the Church, for three days and a half, as appears <hi>v.</hi> 9.11. but in the time of this Prophecy the Dragon hath no ſucceſs at all.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The beginning of this Prophecy doth not contemporate with the beginning of the former, nor the end of this Prophecy with the end of the former, therefore the middle, which is the 1260 days in each Prophecy, do not contemporate each with other. Firſt, I ſay the beginning of this Prophecy doth not contemporate with the beginning of the former, for in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Prophecy, the Church is under the oppoſition and perſecution of the Dragon, but in the beginning of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer while the Temple is in building, the Church is free. Again, in the end of the former Prophecy, the Church is worſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the enemy for three days and a half, but in the end of this Prophecy, the Dragon has the worſt of it, and the Church the better.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Other differences there be, which ſhew they do not Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chroniſe, as firſt the Church in this Prophecy flies away, in that ſhe ſtands to it and flies not. Again, in this Prophecy the Church is in the Wilderneſs, in that ſhe is without in an open place. And thirdly, in this Prophecy the Church is inviſible, and none but the Dragon knew where ſhe was; but in the other Prophecy the Church is viſible, and the <hi>Beaſt</hi> knew where ſhe was, all which do ſhew that they do not Synchroniſe.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>The days of the two Witneſſes, and the days of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans being in the Wilderneſs, are equal in duration, for they be</hi> 1260 <hi>days a piece, therefore they Synchroniſe and contemporate each with other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The month of <hi>January,</hi> and the month of <hi>March</hi> are equal in duration, for they be one and thirty days a piece, yet they ſucceed one the other, and the month of <hi>February</hi> comes between; and no other is the caſe here: the 1260 days of the Propheſying of the Witneſſes, and the 1260 days of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:180584:80"/>being in the Wilderneſs are equal in duration, yet the laſt of theſe ſucceeds the former, as the month of <hi>March</hi> doth the month of <hi>January,</hi> and that which follows in the former Prophecy, from the ſeventh verſe to the end of the chapter, comes between.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But theſe Viſions were preſented both at one time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing or intermiſſion, therefore ſeeing they be equal in duration, they contemporate each with other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Things preſented all at once, at one view, or at one time, may ſucceed one another, witneſs <hi>Nebuchadnezars</hi> Image, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. and the ſeven heads of the <hi>Beaſt, Rev.</hi> 17.3.9, 10. 2. Theſe Viſions were not preſented both at once, at one view, or at one time, as <hi>Nebuchadnezars</hi> Image was, <hi>eodem tempore ſimultaneo,</hi> but ſucceſſively and immediately one after another, as <hi>Daniels</hi> four <hi>Beaſts</hi> were <hi>eodem tempore ſucceſſivo, Dan.</hi> 7. and look in what order they were revealed, in the ſame ſhall they come to paſs, that is ſucceſſively and immediately one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, as <hi>Daniels</hi> four <hi>Beaſts</hi> do, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>The Womans flight into the Wilderneſs was preſented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> John <hi>before the Battail betwixt</hi> Michael <hi>and the</hi> Dragon <hi>did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,</hi> v. 6. <hi>but it ſhall come to paſs afterward, as appears</hi> v. 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I deny the Antecedent, for the ſixth verſe ſhews that the womans flight into the Wilderneſs, was when her Travel ended, and ſhe had brought forth her Son, and the fourteenth verſe alſo ſhews that her flight into the Wilderneſs was when the Battel betwixt <hi>Michael</hi> and the Dragon ceaſed, and he was caſt forth into the earth, therefore the womans Travel, and the battel betwixt <hi>Michael</hi> and the <hi>Dragon</hi> ended both together, and were preſented unto <hi>John</hi> both together, but could not be ſet down in writing both together unleſs it were collaterally, as was ſhewed <hi>pag.</hi> 118. but ſucceſſively as it is one after another, which is the reaſon that the womans flight is ſet down <hi>v.</hi> 6. after her Travel ended, and repeated again <hi>v.</hi> 14. after the Battel end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:180584:80"/>2. Suppoſe it to be true that the womans flight into the Wilderneſs was preſented unto <hi>John</hi> before the Battel betwixt <hi>Michael</hi> and the <hi>Dragon</hi> did begin, if this were ſo, then the ſixth verſe is meant of the beginning of the womans flight into the Wilderneſs, and the fourteenth verſe of the ending of it, and if this be ſo, the Battel betwixt <hi>Michael</hi> and the <hi>Dragon</hi> is not <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante puerperio</hi> during the time of the womans Travel, but <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante fuga</hi> during her flight into the Wilderneſs, and if this latter hold good, then things are ſet down in writing as they were revealed, and ſhall come to paſs accordingly in ſuch order as they be written in the Book, no Book of Scripture equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſing it.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>Three years and a half may ſucceed one another, but</hi> 1260 <hi>days mentioned in theſe two Prophecies, be ſo many years, and it is not likely that ſo many years ſhould ſucceed one another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is not my opinion only, but <hi>Piſcators</hi> in <hi>Apocalyp. Cap.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Peter Moulins</hi> in his accompliſhment of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, <hi>pag.</hi> 194. 196. and the late Annotators on <hi>Daniel c.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 25. who all of them do underſtand by theſe numbers, three years and a half, and no more. Again, the Church is in the Wilderneſs 1260 days together, but the Church never was, nor ever will be in the Wilderneſs ſo many years together. 3. The Church is in ſafety 1260 days, but the Church never yet was, nor ever will be in ſafety from the enemy ſo long a time as 1260 years amount unto. 4. When days be put for years in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, it is uſually expreſſed or intimated in the Text, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.34. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4.6. but here is no mention nor intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any ſuch thing; had not God told <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> that a day goes for a year, neither of them would have ſo underſtood it; but now in the <hi>Revelation</hi> God doth not tell us that a day is put for a year, therefore we may not ſo underſtand it. 5. In other Prophecies of Scripture where days are mentioned, we do not underſtand years thereby, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.19, 20. <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.13,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:180584:81"/>13, 14. <hi>Jona</hi> 3.4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.49. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19. and that becauſe God doth not bid us: ſo then where God doth not bid us by days underſtand years, we may not ſo underſtand it; but now in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> God doth not bid us by days underſtand years as he doth in <hi>Numbers</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> therefore we may not ſo underſtand it. 6.1260 days be no more than time, times, and half a time, and that is no more than three years and a half, as the Annotators on <hi>Daniel,</hi> in their firſt Edition do confeſs, and it may be proved by reaſon, for time is one year, times two years, and half a time is half a year, and ſeven times in the Book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> is ſeven years, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.16. Again it is ſaid in <hi>Daniel,</hi> that <hi>he ſhall wear out the Saints; and they ſhall be given into his hand until a time, times, and half a time, Dan.</hi> 7.25. but now the Saints were never wearied out ſo long together, neither were they ever given into the enemies hand ſo long a time as 1260 years, nor ever will be. And thirdly, there is an Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical proportion obſervable in theſe times, for times is double in quantity to time, and time is double in quantity to half a time. But now if by time we underſtand a thouſand, and by times two hundred, and by half a time ſixty, we deſtroy the proportion, for by this reckoning, time is more than times which ought to be leſs by half, and half a time is leſs than half a time, which ought to be juſt ſo much. You will ſay that there is the like inconvenience in applying this number to 1260 days. I anſwer no, for time, times, and half a time is not 1260 days formally but vertually, neither is it ſo many days <hi>diviſim,</hi> but <hi>conjunctim,</hi> my meaning is, time is not a thouſand days, times two hundred days, and half a time ſixty days, but time is a year, times two years, and half a time is half a year, that is, three years and a half in the total. Now becauſe in three years and a half, there be juſt 1260 days, hence it is that theſe times be even in the total, but not in each ſeveral part, as hath been ſhewed. And fourthly, to make theſe times of <hi>Daniel</hi> to amount to 1260
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:180584:81"/>years, they take a ſtrange courſe, for they turn years into days, and days into years again, firſt they turn three years and a half, into 1260 days, and this they may do, for it is all one in the total, but this will not content them, but when they have ſo done, they turn theſe days into ſo many years, and ſay that 1260 days is 1260 years, and this they may not do, for it is not all one in the total. Others take a ſtranger courſe, and by time, times, and half a time, they underſtand three years and a half, as we do, but then by years they mean myſtical years, and what that is they do not tell us, neither can they tell us, for if a myſtical year be a thouſand years, two myſtical years muſt be two thouſand years, and half a myſtical year half a thouſand years, and then we are gone beyond the number, but if by a myſtical year be meant a hundred years, then two myſtical years muſt be two hundred years, and half a myſtical year half a hundred years, and then we are far ſhort of the number. Such inconveniences do they fall into, which turn the Scripture into myſteries, and make a myſtical ſenſe of a <hi>Revelation.</hi> Laſtly, a thouſand years and upward, is a long time, but by 1260 days is meant a ſhort time, yea the whole time of Satans abode upon the earth from the time he is caſt out of Heaven, is but a ſhort time, as appears <hi>v.</hi> 12. and yet that time is much more than the 1260 days we ſpeak of.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Queſt. <hi>whether this Prophecy were fulfilled in the Reign of</hi> Nero?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This Prophecy was not revealed to <hi>John</hi> till after <hi>Nero</hi>'s Reign, in the time of <hi>Domitian</hi> one of his ſucceſſours as hath been proved ch. 6. <hi>q.</hi> 1. therefore it doth not propheſie of what was done in his Reign.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Prophecy doth belong unto the ſeventh Trumpet, in which the myſtery of God ſhall come to paſs as hath been proved <hi>q.</hi> 1. but <hi>Nero</hi>'s reign did not reach unto the ſeventh Trumpet.</p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:180584:82"/>
                  <p n="3">3. This Prophecy ſhall ſucceed the Prophecy of the two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes as hath been alſo proved, <hi>q.</hi> 2. but that Prophecy of the two witneſſes is long after the Reign of <hi>Nero,</hi> as they with whom I diſpute in this Queſtion do confeſs, for they ſay it came to paſs in the Reign of <hi>Adrian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. By the parturition of this Woman, is meant the national converſion of ſome people or other. Now there were ſome perſons converted to the Faith in the Reign of <hi>Nero,</hi> but what is that to the national converſion of a people? The national converſion of the <hi>Romans</hi> came not to paſs till the days of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> which was long afterward.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The firſt general perſecution of the Church was in the days of <hi>Nero,</hi> and if this Prophecy ſhould be meant of it, the perſecution ſpoken of in this place ſhould be the firſt, but the perſecution in the fifth Seal was before this, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In <hi>Nero</hi>'s perſecution many were ſlain for profeſſing of the Faith, and amongſt them <hi>Peter</hi> was one, and <hi>Paul</hi> another, but in the perſecution here ſpoken of, not any one was ſlain, the <hi>Dragons</hi> power was too weak, as appears <hi>verſ.</hi> 4, 5, 6.13, 14, 15, 16.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, after the parturition of this Woman, the <hi>Dragon</hi> knowes he hath but a ſhort time, but ſince the days of <hi>Nero</hi> to this day the <hi>Dragon</hi> hath had a long time, and how much more is yet to come before the day of Judgement, who can tell?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Queſt. <hi>Whether this Prophecy be meant of the converſion of the</hi> Jews?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The Woman here ſpoken of had upon her head a Crown of twelve Stars, and who ſhould they be but the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The national Church of <hi>Rome</hi> which ſome ſuppoſe to be the Woman here meant, was not converted till the days of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> all the time before that ſhe was in Travail, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:180584:82"/>when ſhe was converted in his time, ſhe did not flie into the Wilderneſs as the Woman here doth, but was advanced to great honour and proſperity in the World, and the head of that Church was the Emperour himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Dragon</hi> with ſeven heads and ten horns, which ſome ſuppoſe to be the Pagan Roman Empire, did no more perſecute the Roman Church after ſhe was converted in the days of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> but as ſoon as that Church was converted, that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire wholly ceaſed as Pagan and became Chriſtian, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution ceaſed with it, but here the caſe is otherwiſe, for as ſoon as the <hi>Dragon</hi> is caſt forth of Heaven to the Earth, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the Woman doth begin.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We read <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.1. <hi>And at that time ſhall</hi> Michael <hi>ſtand up, the great Prince which ſtandeth for the Children of thy people, and there ſhall be a time of trouble, ſuch as never was ſince there was a Nation, even to that ſame time, and at that time thy people ſhall be delivered,</hi> &amp;c. Now who be meant by <hi>Daniels</hi> people but the <hi>Jews,</hi> and who is meant by the Woman here ſpoken of but <hi>Daniels</hi> people whom <hi>Michael</hi> ſtandeth for?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. What doth the Angel mean by the myſtery of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.7. but the converſion of the <hi>Jews?</hi> And when ſhall that myſtery be finiſhed, but when the ſeventh Angel begins to ſound? And when doth this Woman fall in Travail, but at the ſame time too? And if it be ſaid that by the myſtery of God is meant the <hi>end of the world,</hi> and the <hi>ſecond coming of our Lord,</hi> as Doctor <hi>Mayer</hi> doth expound it: To this I anſwer. 1. That the myſtery of God there ſpoken of is the converſion of ſome Church or other, and what Church can we imagine is left unconverted till the ſeventh Trumpet, but the <hi>Jews</hi> only? 2. The converſion of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> is called a myſtery, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.3. 4.6. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.26. and ſo is the converſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> too, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25. But now the converſion of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> is already, and the Apoſtle ſpeaks of it in both thoſe places as a thing then in being,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:180584:83"/>but the converſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> is yet to come, and when ſhall it be finiſhed, but at the beginning of the ſeventh Trumpet, which is the time the Woman here ſpoken of falls in Travail? 3. The converſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> goes before the coming of our Lord, and that which hinders or keeps back the coming of our Lord, is the non-converſion of that Nation, and that which expedites and haſtens the coming of our Lord is the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that Nation as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith in two places, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19, 20,<note place="margin">

The myſtery which the Angel meant is declared by God to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the Prophets in the Old Teſtament, and what do they ſpeak of more than the converſion of the <hi>Jews, Eſa.</hi> 11.11, 12. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 14.1, 2, 3. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 27.12, 13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.7, 8. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.27, 28. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.37, 38. <hi>Jer.</hi> 46.27, 28. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.16, 17. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.4, 5. <hi>Joel.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Amos</hi> 9.11.14, 15. <hi>Zach.</hi> 8.20, 21, 22. with many more the like. 6. The Objection doth ſuppoſe the ſeventh Trumpet is to ſound but one day, and that one day is to be the end of the world; but the Angel ſaith, the ſeventh Trumpet is to ſound more days than one, and the myſtery of God is to be at the beginning of them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.7.

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="2">2. And this Empire ſhall be as cruel againſt the Chriſtian <hi>Jews,</hi> as ever the Greeks, or Perſian, or Babylonian Empires were heretofore to that Nation, and cannot ſufficiently be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphered by one cruel Beaſt alone, but by variety of cruel Beaſts made up together in one, for it ſhall have the body of a ſpeckled Leopard, as the Greek Empire had, and the feet of a cruel Bear, as the Perſian Empire had, and the mouth of a devouring Lion, as the Babylonian Empire had, and to the making up of this Empire, the Devil ſhall reſign unto him his <hi>Militia,</hi> his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Throne, and ſecular authority.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But before he be eſtabliſhed in his Throne, there ſhall be ſome oppoſition made againſt the ſetling, and uniting of this Empire, and in the oppoſition one of his ſeven heads ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a wound by a ſword, to all mens thinking unto death, but his deadly wound ſhall be healed, and after that there ſhall be no more oppoſition, but all the Country far and near

                  <p n="5">5. And he ſhall take upon him, and it ſhall be permitted to him to ſpeak great and proud things amounting to blaſphemy,<note place="margin">

                  <p n="6">6. And he ſhall open his mouth wide unto blaſphemy, and ſhall not be afraid to blaſpheme the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and his name and his Church and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And he ſhall be permitted by God to make War againſt the remnant of the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that ſhall not flie into the Wilderneſs with their brethren, and to overcome them in the War and he ſhall have power over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations, far and near to make them joyn with him, and aſſiſt him in this War.</p>
                  <p n="8">8.

Proſperity cannot contemporate with adverſity, nor the Church in ſafety with the Church in danger; but the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the former Chapter, is in proſperity, or at leaſt in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in the Wilderneſs, as appears <hi>v.</hi> 6.14, 15, 16. and the Dragon cannot hurt her in that place: but in this Prophecy the Church is in adverſity, and the Beaſt is in proſperity, and doth War with her, and overcome her 42 months together, <hi>v.</hi> 5.7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Beaſt is not raiſed by the Dragon till he went to make War with the remnant of the womans ſeed, and he went not from the Wilderneſs to make War with the remnant of her ſeed, till his attempts againſt the woman in the Wilderneſs proved fruſtrate, and ſucceſleſs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.17.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The true order of the Prophecy is this. 1. The woman falls in Travel, and the Dragon ſtands before her to devour her child as ſoon as it was born, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3, 4. 2. <hi>Michael</hi> and his
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:180584:86"/>Angels fight againſt the Dragon, and caſt him forth of Heaven to the earth, that he might not hinder the Nativity of the Child, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8, 9. 3. The woman bringeth forth, and the Dragon perſecutes the woman, and ſhe flies into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6.13, 14. 4. The Dragon ſends a flood of Water after her, to drown her in the Wilderneſs, or drive her out from thence, and the earth opens her mouth, and ſwallows up the flood of water, <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16. 5. the Dragon is angry with the woman, and goes away from the Wilderneſs to the Sea, with an intent to make War with the remnant of her ſeed, <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18. 6.

                  <p n="4">4. They which hold this Prophecy to contemporate with the former, think that by the remnant of the womans ſeed whom the Dragon Warreth with, is meant the Children which ſhe bringeth forth in the Wilderneſs; but this cannot be ſo, for the woman in the Wilderneſs is in ſafety, as appears <hi>v.</hi> 14. and the Dragon cannot War with her nor her Children in that deſolate place: and therefore by the remnant of her ſeed, is not meant the Children which ſhe bringeth forth in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but the Children which were left behind and were not fled into the Wilderneſs with the woman, and theſe be they whom the Dragon Warreth with, but the other are in ſafety.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Ob. 1260 <hi>Days be ſo many years, and</hi> 42 <hi>months be ſo many years too, and it is not likely that times of ſo long continuance ſhould ſucceed one another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This objection hath been anſwered twice already, firſt <hi>ch.</hi> 11. and ſecondly <hi>ch.</hi> 12. and now I will anſwer it the third time, and ſay ſomething elſe unto it. 1. I might ſay that <hi>theologia ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolica non eſt argumentativa,</hi> myſtical Theology is no ſufficient Argument to build our Faith upon; and if men have nothing elſe to ſay for themſelves but myſtical expoſitions of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, it is a ſign that their cauſe is very bad. 2. Times of equal length may ſucceed one another, as appears in the months of the year. So put the caſe that theſe 42 months, and the 1260 days, be ſo many years, yet 'tis poſſible they may ſucceed one another, though not in whole, yet in part; as <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>David</hi> reigned fourty years a piece, yet ſome part of <hi>Solomons</hi> Reign was with <hi>David</hi> his Father before his death, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part after his death. 3. Where ſhall we find in all the Scripture that a month is put for thirty years? I find in many places where 'tis put for thirty days, as <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.23. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.56. but for thirty years never. 4. The <hi>Revelation</hi> it ſelf doth put a difference between a day, a month, and a year, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.15. <hi>which were prepared for an hour, a day, a month, and a year,</hi> where a day is leſs than a month, and a month is leſs than a year. 5. Theſe 42 months is the time of the Beaſts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, and of the Churches great adverſity, but the Church never was nor ever will be in adverſity ſo long, and the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Beaſt that ever was, was never in proſperity ſo many years together, nor ever will be. 6. By this interpretation of 42 months, one may find out the day of Judgment, and ſome
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:180584:87"/>men have been very bold in this point, for they make theſe 42 months to laſt unto the day of Judgment, ſo that by this reckoning the Church will be in a ſad and calamitous conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on until the day of Judgment; and if they can but tell us one thing more, and that is, when theſe 42 months begin, we may eaſily calculate the day when Chriſt ſhall come to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which no modeſt man will adventure once to do, ſeeing Chriſt ſaith of it, <hi>Of that day and hour knoweth no man, no not the Angels of Heaven, but my Father only, Mat.</hi> 24.30. And yet ſuch inconveniences do follow from this interpretation. 7. Will you know the truth of this matter, and be no more deceived with myſtical expoſitions, then take it briefly thus: Theſe 42 months be three years and a half, and no more, and all this time the Beaſt is in proſperity, and makes War againſt the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with good ſucceſs; but as ſoon as this is over, the Beaſts adverſity doth begin, and in the fourteenth Chapter the Angels make a ſlaughter of him, and in the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter the Vials of Gods wrath fall upon him in his own Dominions, and in the nineteenth Chapter Chriſt comes himſelf in perſon, and deſtroyes him, and makes a final end of him, <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>Ob. <hi>The ſixth Trumpet is before the ſeventh, but the Beaſt here ſpoken of, doth War againſt the Witneſſes in the ſixth Trumpet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prophecy of the Woman and the Dragon doth begin, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is not raiſed in the ſeventh Trumpet, after the Prophecy of the Woman and the Dragon have an end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This objection were ſomething, if the Beaſt that Wars againſt the Witneſſes, <hi>ch.</hi> 11. and the Beaſt ſpoken of in this Chapter were the ſame, but what if they be not the ſame? what's become of the objection then? Now that theſe Beaſts be not the ſame, may be proved by theſe reaſons. 1. That Beaſt <hi>ch.</hi> 11. aſcends out of the bottomleſs Pit, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.7. but this in the thirteenth Chapter out of the Sea, <hi>v.</hi> 1. and the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:180584:87"/>Pit in the <hi>Revelation</hi> is never taken for the Sea, or the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Water, but for a deep hole in the element of the earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.1, 2.11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.1.3. 2. That Beaſt hath ſeven heads and five of them fall and never riſe again, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.10. and this Beaſt hath ſeven heads too, and but one of them is wounded, and that wound is healed again, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.3.3. That Beaſt hath ten horns, but no Crowns upon them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.3. and this Beaſt hath ten horns too, and ten Crowns upon them which the other hath not, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.1. 4. That Beaſt hath a woman riding on him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.3. but this Beaſt aroſe out of the Sea, but no woman riding on him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.1. 5. This Beaſt hath another Beaſt with two horns to aſſiſt him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.11, 12. but that Beaſt hath no other Beaſt that we read of to aſſiſt him. 6. That Beaſt is red, of a Scarlet colour all the body over, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.3. but the body of this Beaſt is ſpeckled like a Leopard, the feet like a Bears feet, and the mouth like a Lyons mouth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.2. 7. That Beaſt is raiſed twice, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.8. but this Beaſt though wounded yet doth riſe but once, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.1. 8. The Throne of that Beaſt is <hi>Babylon, Rev.</hi> 17.5. but the Throne of this Beaſt is ſome other place, as may appear if we compare <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.10.19. 9. This Beaſt hath a puiſſant Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and that immediately after <hi>Babylon</hi> is deſtroyed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 19, 20. which cannot well be, if the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Beaſt and this Beaſt be all one. 10. That Beaſt hath an eighth head, which in ſome reſpects is to ſucceed the ſeventh, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.11. but this Beaſt hath no ſuch eighth head which in any wiſe is to ſucceed the ſeventh. Compare we theſe things together, and it may very well be queſtioned whether the Beaſts be the ſame or no.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Suppoſe the Beaſt be the ſame in both places, yet unleſs the head be the ſame too, the objection fails in that reſpect alſo, for the Beaſt hath ſeven heads in all, and one of them may War againſt the Witneſſes in the ſixth Trumpet, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:180584:88"/>head be raiſed in the ſeventh Trumpet. Yea, let us go a little further, and ſuppoſe the head be the ſame too in both places, yet this will not prevail neither, for that head may be depoſed in the ſixth Trumpet before the Prophecy of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and the Dragon doth begin, and be raiſed again in the ſeventh Trumpet to War againſt the womans ſeed, after the Prophecy in the former Chapter hath an end. Look into <hi>ch.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 8. and you ſhall find the Beaſt is raiſed twice. <hi>The Beaſt which thou ſaweſt was, and is not, and ſhall aſcend out of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Pit, and go into perdition.</hi> Here you ſee is a time in which the Beaſt <hi>was,</hi> and this time may be the ſixth Trumpet. Here is next a time in which the Beaſt <hi>is not,</hi> and this time may be at the beginning of the ſeventh or at the <hi>exit</hi> of the ſixth before the Prophecy of the woman and the Dragon doth begin. Here is thirdly a time when the Beaſt <hi>ſhall aſcend out of the bottomleſs Pit,</hi> and be again, and this may be the time ſpoken of in this chapter, after the Prophecy in the former chapter hath an end. Now of theſe two anſwers the Reader hath his liberty to chooſe which he liketh beſt, but were I to chooſe my ſelf, I would chooſe the firſt before the ſecond, and that for that very reaſon which is urged in the objection, for the Beaſt hath a being and doth War againſt the Witneſſes in the ſixth Trumpet, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is not raiſed or begins to be in the ſeventh. So that it doth not follow that the Prophecies ſhall not come to paſs in order as they were revealed, or that the Prophecy of this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter ſhall not ſucceed the Prophecy in the former chapter: but it rather follows that the Beaſts be not the ſame, as was ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>Ob. <hi>The Kingdom of the Beaſt hath a final end with the ſixth Trumpet,</hi> Rev. 11.14. <hi>and therefore the Prophecies ſhall not come to paſs in order as they were revealed, nor the Prophecy of this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter ſucceed the Prophecy of the former Chapter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It may be queſtioned whether this Beaſt and that in
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:180584:88"/>
                     <hi>ch.</hi> 11. be the ſame as was ſaid before. 2. Whether they be the ſame or no, I deny the Kingdom of the beaſt hath a final end with the ſixth Trumpet, and that for theſe reaſons. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we read of his Acts afterward, <hi>ch.</hi> 17. 2. Becauſe <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> is not deſtroyed till then. 3. Becauſe the City ſpoken of <hi>ch.</hi> 11. is not <hi>Babylon</hi> but <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> it is not the ſeat of the beaſt, but of the two Witneſſes. 4. The tenth part of the City falls, and no more, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.13. 5. Seven thouſand men are ſlain, and no more, and what is that to a final deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the beaſt? 6. It is not ſaid that the beaſt was among them. 7. Suppoſe he were among them, and alſo ſlain with them, yet all this will not put an end to the Kingdom of the beaſt, but to one head only, for the beaſt hath ſeven heads in all; and put the caſe that one of them doth die in the time of the ſixth Trumpet, yet another may ſucceed him in the ſeventh, there being ſome interval between, I mean between the death of the one, and the riſing of the other, and ſo that which is ſpoken of the beaſt, <hi>ch.</hi> 11. belongs to the account of the ſixth Trumpet, and that which is ſpoken of him in the chapters fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, to the account of the ſeventh.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Queſt. <hi>Whether this Prophecy were fulfilled in the Reign of</hi> Domitian?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This Prophecy was not revealed to <hi>John</hi> till the Reign of <hi>Domitian</hi> was well nigh over, as both <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Jerom,</hi> and others do teſtifie, and therefore it doth not Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of what was to be done in his Reign, for if it did, it would have been revealed ſooner, for <hi>Domitian</hi> did not live two years, much leſs three years and a half after this Prophecy was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Prophecy doth belong unto the ſeventh Trumpet, and therefore ſhall ſucceed all the Prophecies of the former Trumpets, but <hi>Domitian</hi> did not live to ſee any of the former Trumpets finiſhed, and they with whom I deal in this queſtion
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:180584:89"/>confeſs themſelves that the Prophecy <hi>ch.</hi> 11. was not fulfilled till the time of <hi>Adrian,</hi> who began his Reign after <hi>Domitian</hi> twenty years.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By the beaſt is not meant the Idol Worſhip as they would have it, but a Kingdom with its King, for by that word is meant both, and ſometimes that word denotes the King, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.11, 12. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.17. and ſometimes beſides the King it denotes the Kingdom, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.3. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.23. and ſo 'tis taken in this place: and beſides this the Idol-worſhip was ſet up at <hi>Rome</hi> before <hi>Domitians</hi> Reign began, and therefore <hi>John</hi> doth not Propheſie of the riſing of it in the time of his Reign; to which may be added that the beaſt was to continue 42 months, but the Idol-worſhip did continue longer.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The head which <hi>John</hi> ſaw as it were wounded to death, is not the Capitol as they ſuppoſe, but one of the Kings of the Empire, as appears by the acception of that word, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.10. And beſides this the head was wounded by a Sword, <hi>v.</hi> 14. but the Capitol was burnt by fire, and that fire was cauſed by Lightning from Heaven. To which may be added, that the head here wounded, was wounded but once, but the Capitol was burnt in the time of <hi>Vitellius,</hi> and rebuilt in the time of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> and after that burnt again in the time of <hi>Titus,</hi> and rebuilt by <hi>Domitian;</hi> and this healing of the beaſts wound, was a matter of admiration, but the rebuilding of the Capitol after it was burnt, was no matter of admiration, but a feaſible thing.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It was given to this beaſt to make War with the Saints, and to overcome them, <hi>v.</hi> 7. which words do imply reſiſtance on the Saints part, but in the perſecution of <hi>Domitian</hi> there was no reſiſtance on the Saints part, the Chriſtians in his days thought it better to fly than to fight.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. By the ſecond beaſt <hi>v.</hi> 11. is meant ſome famous witch or other, ſuch a one as the Devil never had the like ſince he
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:180584:89"/>was a Devil, but this witch cannot be <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus,</hi> as they ſuppoſe, for neither he nor any other ſince his time could do ſuch feats as this witch is ſaid to do, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13, 14, 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Domitianus Apollonio infeſtus fuit, &amp; Apollonius Domitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> ſaith <hi>Grotius de Antichriſto, pag.</hi> 77. <hi>Domitian</hi> was a hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enemy to <hi>Apollonius,</hi> and <hi>Apollonius</hi> to <hi>Domitian,</hi> but the falſe Prophet here ſpoken of was the chiefeſt Friend the beaſt had, and uſed all the art he could to eſtabliſh him in his throne, <hi>v.</hi> 12.14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.13.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Neither the beaſt nor the witch here ſpoken of do die a bodily death as other men do, but are both caſt into Hell alive, as appears, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19, 20. but <hi>Domitian</hi> and <hi>Apollonius</hi> died both of them a bodily death, and <hi>Domitian</hi> died firſt, and <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus</hi> afterward, the one died <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 98. the other <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 99. according to <hi>Baronius,</hi> ſee <hi>Prideaux Hiſtory, pag.</hi> 198.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Queſt. <hi>Whether the Prophecy of the firſt Beaſt be fulfilled in the Papacy, and be meant of them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The firſt beaſt is a ſecular power, but the Pope is an eccleſiaſtical perſon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the Pope be the ſeventh head of the firſt beaſt, who then is the ſeventh head of the Dragon? for he had ſo many heads before the beaſt began, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.3.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the Pope be the ſeventh head of the firſt beaſt, who be the other ſix? Kings, Conſuls, Dictators, Decemvirs, Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tribunes, and Emperors of <hi>Rome</hi> till <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time were all of them Pagans; but if the Prophecy were fulfilled in the Papacy, all the ſeven heads ſhould be Papiſts, elſe the Prophecy cannot be fulfilled in them. 2. If the ſix firſt heads be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, and the ſeventh head be Popes, the beaſt is more Pagan than Papiſt, and the Prophecy is not fulfilled wholly in the Pagans, nor wholly in the Papiſts, but partly in the one, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:180584:90"/>partly in the other, but moſt of all in the Pagans. 3. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be that the ſix firſt heads of the beaſt ſhould be Kings, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, Dictators, Decemvirs, Military Tribunes, and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, for five of theſe were paſt before the Prophecy was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, the Emperours then were, but the beaſt which <hi>John</hi> ſaw riſe out of the Sea, had ſeven heads, whereof none of them were paſt, none of them were preſent, but all of them were then to come, for after the Viſions in the three firſt chapters, <hi>John</hi> had no more Viſions of things preſent, much leſs of things paſt, but only of things that were to come, as the Angel told him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Come up hither, and I will ſhew thee things which muſt be hereafter,</hi> therefore not heads which were then paſt, nor heads which were then preſent, but heads which were then to come, and if five of theſe heads were then paſt, one were then preſent, it had been ſufficient to have preſented unto <hi>John</hi> the head that was then to come, and no more. And if it be ſaid that the Angel ſpeaking of theſe heads, <hi>ch.</hi> 17. ſaith, <hi>five of them are fallen, one is, and the ſeventh is not yet come,</hi> to this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that the riſing of that beaſt is not preſented unto <hi>John</hi> in that Viſion, but the deſtruction of the Whore which ſits upon him; and when 'tis ſaid that <hi>five of them are fallen,</hi> this is not to be underſtood Hiſtorically of what was paſt before the Apoſtles days, nor of what was preſent in his days, but prophetically of what ſhould be paſt before, and what ſhould be preſent at the execution of that Prophecy.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The beaſt hath not only ſeven heads, but alſo ten horns, and ten crowns upon them, and that at one time, and not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively one after another; but where ſhall we find ſo many horns in the Papacy, and ten crowns upon them at one time, and not ſucceſſively one after another.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The beaſt <hi>was like a Leopard, and his feet as the feet of a Bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a Lyon,</hi> Rev. 13.2. Now a Leopard was the emblem of the Greek Monarchy, a Bear the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:180584:90"/>emblem of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy, and a Lyon the emblem of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.4, 5, 6. and therefore this beaſt is made up of all the three, partly of the <hi>Greek,</hi> partly of the <hi>Perſian,</hi> and partly of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Empires, but the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy doth conſiſt of none of theſe, for they were ſecular Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies in the Eaſt, but the Papacy is a ſpiritual Monarchy in the Weſt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>One of the Beaſts heads was as it were wounded to death, and his deadly wound was healed,</hi> Rev. 13.3. but when was any head ſo wounded in the Papacy, and afterward healed, and who ſhould that Popiſh head be? It cannot be ſaid that this was done when the Dragon was dethroned, and caſt forth of Heaven, for the beaſt was not then in being, and not one head only but all the Dragons heads were caſt out of Heaven with him. It cannot be ſaid that this was done when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> became Chriſtian, for that was before the Papacy did begin, and there was not any Popiſh head wounded then, nor any Popiſh head healed at that time. And thirdly the meaning is not that one head was wounded, and another head was healed, but the meaning is, that one head was wounded, and the ſame head was healed. Now the Emperors were one head, and the Popes another head, and it cannot be ſaid that the Emperors were heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when the Popes came up in their room, no more than it can be ſaid that the Kings were healed when the Conſuls did ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them, or that the Conſuls were healed when they were put down, and the Dictators did ſucceed them; and ſuppoſe the Popes ſhould be put down, and the Emperors come up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, it cannot be ſaid that the Popes wound was healed by that means.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The beaſt was to continue 42 months, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.5. that is three years and a half, as hath been proved in the former que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions. Now theſe 42 months are not the time of the beaſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, but the time of his proſperity, and no more: but the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:180584:91"/>Pope hath lived in proſperity more than 42 months, and many more he is like to live, and therefore he is not the beaſt that here is ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. They that underſtand this Prophecy of the Papacy, do confeſs that the Pope is not the firſt beaſt but the ſecond, and they underſtand by the firſt beaſt the ſecular power of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by the ſecond the Eccleſiaſtical, and yet in reckoning up the ſeven heads of the firſt beaſt they make the Pope one, and who the ſeven heads ſhould be and leave the Pope out they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Queſt. <hi>whether the Prophecy of the ſecond Beaſt be fulfilled in the Papacy, and be meant of them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The ſecond beaſt is a ſecular power, as the firſt beaſt is, and a beaſt in Scripture is never taken for any other power than a ſecular, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.3, 4, 5, 6, 7.17.23. but the Pope is an Eccleſiaſtical power, not a ſecular.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the Pope be the ſecond beaſt, who then is the ſeventh head of the firſt beaſt, for they be two diſtinct perſons, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.11, 12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſecond beaſt <hi>doth exerciſe all the power of the firſt beaſt before him,</hi> or in his behalf, <hi>v.</hi> 12. Now that power is a ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar power, for that beaſt is a ſecular beaſt, as all confeſs. Now what beaſt is there in the World whoſe ſecular power the Pope doth exerciſe in his behalf? This the Pope never did, it is too mean for his ſupremacy who thinks himſelf above all Kings and Princes in the World, to exerciſe the power of another in his behalf, neither will he ever do it, except he ceaſe to be a Pope, and become a Lay-man.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The ſecond beaſt <hi>doth great wonders, ſo that he maketh fire come down from heaven upon earth in the ſight of men,</hi> v. 13. and when did the Pope do this, and what ſhould this fire be? It cannot be the holy Ghoſt, as ſome would have it, for he is not at the beaſts command as this fire is, and 'tis a wicked thing for any
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:180584:91"/>man to think that this wicked Beaſt can bring the Holy Ghoſt down from Heaven when he will. It cannot be meant of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication as others would have it, for that is no wonder as this fire is, but a common thing, and a ſpiritual duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on the Biſhops and Paſtors of the Church which are not Papiſts. It remains then that this fire is true material fire as that which fell on <hi>Jobs</hi> cattel was, <hi>Job</hi> 1.16. and this may be done by art Magick, and is one of the great wonders of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Beaſt that he can make fire come down from Heaven upon earth in the ſight of men to bring them in ſubjection to the firſt Beaſt, which was never yet effected nor attempted by the Pope and his Clergy to bring men in ſubjection to a ſecular power, for which end it is effected here, but is yet to be expected.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The ſecond Beaſt <hi>ſaith to the Inhabitants' of the earth, that they ſhould make an Image to the Beaſt which had the wound of a Sword and did live. And he had power to give breath unto the Image of the Beaſt, that the Image of the Beaſt ſhould both ſpeak, and cauſe that as many as would not worſhip the Image of the Beaſt ſhould be killed,</hi> v. 14, 15. And when did the Pope do this? What Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror is there in the World whoſe Image the Pope cauſed to be made unto him? When did he give breath to ſuch an Image? And when did he make ſuch an Image ſpeak, and command that as many as would not worſhip it ſhould be killed? and what ſhould this Image be but a Molten or a Carved Image, as <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzars</hi> Image was? Look we all the Scripture over, and we ſhall never find an Image made by man (as this Image of the Beaſt is) taken for any other Image than a Molten or a carved I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Image was, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and becauſe the Pope never did this, the Prophecy is not fulfilled in him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The ſecond Beaſt <hi>cauſeth all both ſmall and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, and that no man might buy or ſell, ſave he that had the mark or the name of the Beaſt, or the number of his name,</hi> v. 16, 17. And
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:180584:92"/>vvhen was this fulfilled in the Papacy? To this 'tis ſaid that this mark is nothing elſe but the promiſe of obedience; to which I anſwer. 1. That the Beaſts mark is ſomething elſe beſides the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of obedience to the Beaſt, for the promiſe of obedience is a common thing between King and Subject all the World over, but the mark of the Beaſt is peculiar to the Beaſt alone. 2. The promiſe of obedience is made unto the Beaſt, but the mark of the Beaſt is received from the Beaſt, not impoſed on the Beaſt, <hi>v.</hi> 16. 3. Suppoſe a man hath promiſed obedience to the Beaſt how ſhall it be known that he hath ſo done? And when he comes into a Market or a Fair to buy or ſell, how ſhall it be known that he hath promiſed obedience to the Beaſt, except he have his mark to diſtinguiſh him from others? For the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the mark is given, is that ſuch perſons may be known from others, and no man is to buy or ſell that is without it, and this is a courſe which the Pope never took as yet, nor is ever like to do, and if he ſhould do ſuch a thing hereafter, yet he were not the Beaſt, for the Beaſt did it at his firſt riſing out of the earth which the Pope did not.</p>

Will you know the mark of the Beaſt, and the name of the Beaſt, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his name? indeed you muſt go another way to work than hitherto hath been gone, and the way that you muſt go, is this, 666 is not <hi>numerus numeratus,</hi> the number of the Beaſt counted to our hand, but <hi>numerus numerandus</hi> the number to be counted by us. Now the way to count this number is, not by addition or ſubtraction, for here is no other number which this number can be added to, or ſubtracted from, neither is it to be done by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication or diviſion, for here is no other number which it can be multiplied or divided by; therefore to count that number, is to extract the root thereof.

And when you ſee a Beaſt with ſeven Heads, and ten Horns, and another Beaſt with one head and two Hornes, like a Lamb, to exerciſe all his civil power and authority in his behalf, and cauſe his Subjects to be marked in their right hand, or in their foreheads with the Capital or Acroſtick Letters of his name, and the letters of that mark be in numeration, 25 or 26, then he is the Beaſt that here is propheſied of, and becauſe this hath not been done in the Papacy, this Prophecy is not fulfilled in them, but is yet to be expected. Hitherto I have ſhewed you who the Beaſt is not, I will now diſcover unto you who the Beaſt is.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Queſt. <hi>Whether this Prophecy be meant of the perſecution of the</hi> Jews <hi>after their Converſion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This Prophecy is to come to paſs in the time of the ſeventh Trumpet, as hath been proved, <hi>q.</hi> 1. and the myſtery of God, by which is meant the Converſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall come to paſs at that time too, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What is meant by the woman in the former Chapter but the Nation of the <hi>Jews?</hi> and wherefore is this Beaſt raiſed by the Devil, but to make War againſt the remnant of her ſeed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.17?</p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:180584:93"/>
                  <p n="3">3. We read in <hi>Daniel</hi> that the little Horn who is thought to be the Beaſt here ſpoken of, <hi>made war with the Saints and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed againſt them, Dan.</hi> 7.21, 22.25. Now who are meant by the Saints in <hi>Daniel</hi> but the <hi>Jews?</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. VVe read in the Prophet <hi>Micah, According to the days of thy coming out of the Land of</hi> Egypt <hi>will I ſhew unto him mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous things, the Nations ſhall ſee and be confounded,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p n="7">7. The Beaſts which now are in the world came to their height and eminency by long and tedious wars and by the ruines of other Nations, but this Beaſt is raiſed on a ſudden by the Devils art and policy, as you may read <hi>v.</hi> 2.4. and there are ſuch ſtrange courſes taken, ſuch witchcraft and inchantment uſed, ſuch ſigns and wonders ſhewed, ſuch cunning and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful tricks invented, and ſuch a ſtrange mark impoſed by the ſecond Beaſt to make men adhere unto the firſt Beaſt, as

                  <p>The concluſion therefore is, The Antichriſt of St. <hi>John,</hi> St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Man of ſin, and the Beaſt here ſpoken of be not all one. The Antichriſts of St. <hi>John</hi> be the falſe Chriſts that our Saviour ſpeaks of in the Goſpel <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.24. which ſhould ſtart up before and after the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.18.22 and 4.3.2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> All believers are united unto Chriſt in the common way of Union, and that is by the ſpirit on Gods part, and by Faith on mans part, but to be the lifeguard of the Lamb (which the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion to follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth, doth allude unto) or to be <hi>triarii milites</hi> his ableſt, and his choiceſt Souldiers in his Wars againſt the Beaſt, is a ſpecial way of Union and proper to theſe Virgins only.</p>
                  <p>The Concluſion therefore is, The Virgin Company for their number be 144000. neither more nor leſs; for Nation they be <hi>Jews,</hi> and not <hi>Gentiles;</hi> for Religion they be Chriſtians, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtians too; for age they be young and not old; for Sex they be Males, and not Females; for ſtate of life they be Virgins, and not married perſons; for office and calling they be Souldiers, the Victorious Army of the Lamb, by whom he Wars againſt the Beaſt, and gets the Victory againſt him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.14.

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. A <hi>Revelation</hi> cannot be a myſtery, for a <hi>Revelation</hi> is a manifeſtation of things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were hidden and ſecret,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.28. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.26. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.25, 16. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.26.</note> but a myſtery is, when things are hidden, and ſecret ſtill, but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of the ſeven Vials, is a ſpecial part of a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where there is a myſtery in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> it is uſually interpreted, as the firſt Chapter, and the ſeventeenth do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, but here is no interpretation of any myſtery in the Vials.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. No Scripture is myſtically to be underſtood, <hi>ſine evidente neceſſitate,</hi> without evident neceſſity, but here is no neceſſity, much leſs an evident one, ſo to underſtand it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Where a literal ſenſe may ſtand, that which is furtheſt from the letter is the worſt, but here a literal ſenſe may ſtand. For 1. It is not repugnant to any Text of Scripture. 2. It is not contrary to any Article of the Chriſtian Faith. 3. There is no iniquity therein. 4. There is no abſurdity at all doth follow therefrom, therefore it is literally to be underſtood.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Plagues of <hi>Aegypt</hi> are literally to be underſtood, but the ſeven Vials are for the moſt part the ſame for kind with the Plagues of <hi>Aegypt.</hi>

The ſecond and third Vials anſwer to another Plague of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where all the Water in the River was turned to blood, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.20, 21. and what living ſoul will ſay that that is myſtically to be underſtood?

The laſt Vial anſwers to the hail which fell upon the Land of <hi>Aegypt, Exod.</hi> 9 22, 23, 24. and who will ſay that that hail is myſtically to be underſtood? only the fourth and ſixth Vials differ in kind from the Plagues of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but the reſt that are mentioned in this Chapter, are the ſame with theirs.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. From the myſtical interpretation of the Vials, many ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities will follow. As 1. It makes the Prophecy but a common Prophecy, and to ſpeak of things ordinary and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed; when as the literal ſenſe makes it a Prophecy extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and to ſpeak of things not uſual nor accuſtomed, ſuch as never were but in the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and they that were in <hi>Aegypt</hi> though the ſame for kind were not ſo grievous as theſe Vials are like to be. 2. It makes the Scripture a noſe of Wax, which a man may turn which way he will, one may turn it one way, and another may turn it another way, and there be well nigh as many interpretations of the myſtical ſenſe, as there be writers on the <hi>Revelation.</hi> 3. It ſubjects the Scripture to our vain luſts, and humours, and gives every one liberty to interpret it as his humour leads him. 4. It makes the Scripture mean not what it ſpeaks, but what men would have it mean. 5. It makes men interpret the <hi>Revelation</hi> of themſelves or of their own party, and of the times wherein they live, and the good things they think are ſpoken of themſelves, and the evil things of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. 6. It turns the Scripture into nonſenſe, what ſenſe is it to ſay, that by the <hi>earth</hi> in the firſt Vial, is meant the loweſt of the People, as if an Ulcer could not fall upon the higheſt, as well as upon the loweſt? What ſenſe is it to ſay, every living ſoul died in the <hi>Sea,</hi> that is, in the extent and compaſs of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal power and Juriſdiction, when as there be five Vials to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome men afterward? What ſenſe is it to ſay, that the <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:180584:105"/>in the fifth Vial is meant of ſpiritual darkneſs, as if they were not ſpiritually dark before that or any other of the Vials did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin? What ſenſe is it to underſtand by the Kings of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> in the ſixth Vial the Kings of the Weſt, and by the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which is a River in the Eaſt to underſtand the Popes revenues in the Weſt, and by the drying up of that River, to underſtand the draining away the Popes revenues in the Weſt? theſe and many more abſurdities do follow from the myſtical interpretation of the Vials.</p>
                  <p>Ob. <hi>If we take the Earth, Sea, Rivers, and Fountains of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in a literal ſenſe, how ſhould a Vial of wrath poured out on theſe; be any wit more prejudicial (without a miracle) to Gods enemies then his Friends, who partake of the benefit of theſe in common with the other?</hi>

Whereas 'tis ſaid (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Micah. 7.15, 16.3. Whereas 'tis ſaid that they partake of the benefit of theſe in common with the other, it is nothing ſo at this time, for the Saints do not live in the Beaſts Dominions at this time, or in that part of them where the Vials fell, for they were either ſlain or fled out of his Dominions before any of the Vials did begin. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.6.14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Did men never read the Book of <hi>Exodus?</hi> Did ever the Rivers and Fountains of <hi>Aegypt</hi> literally ſhed the blood of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites?</hi> Yet God turned them to blood as a Plague on the <hi>Aegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians, Exod.</hi> 7.17, 18, 19, 20, 21. and no other is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here. <hi>The third Angel poured out his Vial on the Rivers and Fountains of Waters, and they became blood,</hi> v. 4. and wherefore is this done, but in way of revenge upon the men, that they might not have the benefit of the waters, as heretofore they had, and that becauſe <hi>they</hi> (that is the men which drank of thoſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) <hi>ſhed the blood of the Saints, and the Prophets, and thou haſt given them</hi> (that is the men) <hi>blood to drink.</hi>

                  <p>Ob. <hi>The Book of</hi> Exodus <hi>is a Hiſtory, but the</hi> Revelation <hi>is a Prophecy, and therefore may not be compared each with other.</hi>

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:180584:106"/>it was fulfilled, the difference many times is not in reſpect of matter, but in reſpect of time. A Prophecy is the relating of a thing to come, and a Hiſtory is the relating of a thing paſt, but the thing related may be materially the ſame in both, 2. The Book of <hi>Exodus</hi> is both a Hiſtory, and a Prophecy; for the words in <hi>Exodus</hi> 7.20, 21. are a Hiſtory of turning the waters into blood, but the words, <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18. are a Prophecy of it before hand. So again the words in <hi>Exodus,</hi> 9, 10, 11. are a Hiſtory of the Boyl which fell upon the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> but the words <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9. are a Prophecy of the Boyl before it came to paſs. So thirdly the words in <hi>Exodus</hi> 10.22. are a Hiſtory of the darkneſs that was in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but the words <hi>v.</hi> 21. are a Prophecy thereof, and therefore the compariſon in all the three places with the Vials of the <hi>Revelation</hi> is very fit and ſuitable each to other.</p>
                  <p>Ob. <hi>How can a Vial be poured on the Sun; and not on the Saines which live under it? or how can the Sun torment men with fervent heat, and the Saints not be tormented by it?</hi>

One man and his Family may be viſited with a Feaver in a hot Summer ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and his next neghbours Houſe or his Family may eſcape. 4. The Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>the Sun ſha'l not ſinite thee by day, nor the Moon by night,</hi> Pſ. 121.6. this ſtrikes the objection quite dead, one man may be ſmitten by the Sun, and not another, though they live both of them near together. 5. The Sun is more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant in one Country then another, ſo that the Beaſt and his men may be ſcorched by the Sun, and the Saints which are fled
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:180584:106"/>out of his Dominions, may eſcape. 6. The Beaſt would not ſuffer any of the Saints to live in his Dominions in peace, he ſlew as man of them as he could come by, and after they were dead, and the reſt fled away, theſe Vials fell upon them. 7. They that interpret the Vials myſtically, ſay that by the <hi>earth</hi> one ſort of men is meant, by the <hi>Sea</hi> another, by the <hi>Rivers and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Waters</hi> a third, and by the <hi>Sun</hi> a fourth, yet all of theſe be wicked men: now if the Vials can diſtinguiſh between one wicked man, and another, ſo that one wicked man is puniſhed under one Vial, and not another, why can they not as well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between a wicked man, and a good, though under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in a literal ſenſe? 8. The Angels are the pourers forth of theſe Vials, and they can ſo order and diſpoſe of them, that they ſhall fall only on the wicked, and not upon the good. 9.

AND one of the ſeven Angels which had the eſſuſion of the ſeven Vials in my Viſion, and ſhall have the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them when they are to be executed, came unto me in my Viſion, and talked with me, ſaying, come hither, and I will ſhew thee the deſtruction of the great Whoriſh City, which at the commencement of this ſeventh Vial, ſhall rule over many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and who they be that ſhall deſtroy her.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. With whom the Kings of the earth ſhall commit Idolatry, and the Inhabiters of the ſame ſhall be made drunk with her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and alſo with her corporal Fornication.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. So he took me aſide, and carried me in a Viſion of my mind into the Wilderneſs, where I ſaw a woman repreſenting not what was then in being, but what ſhall be hereafter, ſitting upon a Scarlet coloured Beaſt, full of names of Blaſphemy many ways committed againſt God and Jeſus Chriſt, and the Beaſt had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven heads, and ten Horns, repreſenting what ſhould be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And the woman which I ſaw, was arrayed in coſtly appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of Purple and Scarlet colour, and decked with Gold, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Stones, and Pearls, and ſhe had a cup of Gold in her hand, (repreſenting ſtill what ſhould be hereafter) full of abominable ſins and wickedneſs, and alſo moſt grievous and loathſome For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And in her forehead ſhe had a name written, declaring what manner of City ſhe ſhould be, not perſpicuouſly, but in a myſtery; <hi>Babylon</hi> the great, the Mother of Whoredoms, and vile abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the earth.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 And beſides all this, I ſaw the Woman exceeding drunk with the blood of the Saints of God, and of the Martyrs of Jeſus Chriſt; and when I ſaw ſhe was ſuch a one, I wondred greatly, with exceeding admiration, what this Woman ſhould mean.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And as I was thus wondring in my mind, the Angel ſaid unto me, wherefore didſt thou wonder and continue in ſo doing; I will tell thee what is meant by this wicked woman, and what is meant by the Beaſt that beareth her, which hath ſeven heads and ten Horns.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The Beaſt which thou ſaweſt, is a King which ſhall have a Crown, and looſe it, and obtain his Crown again, and then go into Perdition, and never have a being any more; he ſhall have a
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:180584:110"/>Crown before the ſeventh Vial ſhall commence, he ſhall looſe it a little after the commencement of it, and obtain the ſame again, and go into Perdition too, before this ſeventh Vial ſhall be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and all the Inhabitants of the earth, which were not elected to Salvation, ſhall wonder at it, when they ſee the Beaſt which ſhall have a Crown, and looſe it to obtain his Crown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And this is the ſenſe and meaning of the Viſion, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven heads, be ſeven Mountains, upon which the City ſhall be built.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And they do alſo ſignifie ſeven Kings, five of them ſhall fall and be dead, and gone before the ſeventh Vial ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence; the ſixth ſhall be alive at the commencement of that Vial, and the ſeventh is then to be expected, and when he cometh to the Crown, he ſhall enjoy it but a little while.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And the Beaſt which ſhall have a Crown and looſe it, he ſhall be the eighth King, and ſucceed the ſeventh, and yet be of the number of the ſeven too, and go into Perdition, and be no more for ever.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And the ten Horns which thou ſaweſt the Beaſt to have, do alſo ſignifie ten Kings, which as yet have not received a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, nor ſhall have any one before the Beaſt hath loſt his, and recovered it again, and then they ſhall receive power to Reign as Kings in one Kingdom one hour with the Beaſt, and this ſhall be when the ſeventh Vial ſhall commence, and in the time of it, and not before.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And though they be ten, yet they ſhall have but one mind, and adhere unto the Beaſt with one conſent, and give their War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like power and ſtrength to the aſſiſtance of the Beaſt, till the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious City be deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. And yet we may not think that they be Chriſtian Kings, for after this is done, they ſhall fight againſt the Lamb, and the Lamb ſhall overcome them in the War, and though they be Kings
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:180584:111"/>themſelves, yet he is a greater King then they, even the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and they that be with him, and on his ſide be choſen, and better Souldiers then any the ten Kings have, and alſo Faithful to him too.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. And the Angel alſo told me, what is meant by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon which the woman ſitteth, and he ſaid unto me, that they do ſignifie multitudes of People, and Nations of divers Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. And the ten Horns which thou ſaweſt the Beaſt to have, be they which ſhall hate the Whore, not for her Religion, but for her Rebellion againſt the Beaſt, and make her deſolate and naked without Inhabitants, and ſlay her People with the Sword, and burn her Houſes with fire.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And that which ſhall make them do it is, becauſe God ſhall put it into their hearts to fulfill his mind and will, and agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to give their Kingdom to the Beaſt, until the City be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and no longer.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. And the woman which thou ſaweſt, doth ſignifie the great imperial City, which at the commencement of this ſeventh Vial, ſhall have Dominion over the Kings and Nations of the earth, and then it ſhall be known by name, what this wicked, Idolatrous, and Blaſphemous City is.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. Where ſhall we find ſeven Hills in <hi>Rome,</hi> and no more? Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> had ſo many, whoſe names are reckoned in the former Section, but beſides theſe, there were three more added to the City afterward, whereof the firſt was called <hi>collis hortulorum</hi> the Hill of Gardens, the ſecond <hi>mons aureus</hi> the Golden Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the third <hi>Vaticanus</hi> the <hi>Vatican</hi> Mountain, ſo that <hi>Rome</hi> firſt and laſt had ten in all, and as for Papal <hi>Rome</hi> that now is, it hath but two, and no more.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Is there no City in the world which hath ſeven Hills, but <hi>Rome,</hi> if there be as indeed there is, for <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſtands on ſeven Hills at this day, and ſo many other Cities too for ought we know, therefore let not men be too peremptory in this point, but conſider what they ſay.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The ſeven heads be ſeven Kings, but where ſhall we find
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:180584:112"/>ſo many Kings in <hi>Rome,</hi> and no more? For if we take Kings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and underſtand thereby ſo many Monarchs as the ten Kings, <hi>v.</hi> 12. are taken properly for ſo many Monarchs, where ſhall we find ſo many Kings in <hi>Rome,</hi> and no more? Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> had Kings and Emperours before Popes began, but they were more then ſeven, and Papal <hi>Rome</hi> hath not one.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Suppoſe by ſeven Kings be meant ſeven kinds of Governours, as 'tis commonly interpreted, where ſhall we find ſo many kinds in <hi>Rome?</hi> For Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> had not ſo many, and Papal <hi>Rome</hi> hath but one, and it is not likely that Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> and Papal too, ſhould be meant in this place.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But let us joyn them both together, and take <hi>Rome</hi> in its la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as it compriſeth Heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> and Papal too, yet where ſhall we find ſo many kinds of Governours in <hi>Rome? Kings, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, Dictators, Decemvirs, Military Tribunes, Emperours,</hi> and <hi>Popes</hi> make not up the number. For the Dictators differed not from Kings but in name,<note place="margin">Godwins <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities, p.</hi> 171.174, 175.</note> and in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of their office, and the Kings differed not from Emperours but in name, and if theſe three be but one kind of Governours, where then be the other ſix?</p>
                     <p n="7">7. There is a great difference between the <hi>Roman</hi> Beaſt, and the <hi>Roman</hi> State; now 'tis true, the <hi>Roman</hi> State had many heads, but the <hi>Roman</hi> Beaſt, that is, the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire had but one, and that is the Emperours, and no more.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. None of the ſeven heads which the Prophecy ſpeake h of did live and rule together, but the Dictators lived and ruled with ſome of the Conſuls while they ſtood,<note place="margin">Helvicus, <hi>pag.</hi> 66.68.</note> and alſo with ſome of the Tribunes while they ſtood, and therefore the Dictators and the Conſuls be none of the heads which the Prophecy ſpeaketh of.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Every one of theſe heads which the Prophecy ſpeaketh of, be long laſting heads, and of long continuance, except the ſeventh,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:180584:113"/>but the Dictators were but for half a year, and they were never choſen, but when the common-weal was in ſome great trouble or danger, and at half a years end under pain of Treaſon, they yielded up their office.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Every one of theſe heads, be the heads of a Beaſt, that is, of an Empire, for thats the meaning of the word Beaſt, as appears <hi>Dan</hi> 7.17.23. but the Conſuls, Dictators, Decemvirs, and Military Tribunes were not the heads of an Empire, but of a Common-weal, for <hi>Rome</hi> was not an Empire till the Emperours began, and the firſt of them was <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11. Every one of theſe heads were ſupreme heads, and not ſubject to the power and authority of others, but the Conſuls, Dictators, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were ſubject to the Senate, and under their Command; and therefore they be not the heads here ſpoken of.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. None of theſe heads did riſe again after they were fallen, except the eighth; but the Conſuls whom they reckon for the ſecond head did riſe again after they were fallen: For firſt, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemvirs did ſucceed them for two years or thereabout, and when they were ended, the Conſuls roſe again: next the Military Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes came up in their places, and that more then once or twice, and as often as they fell, the Conſuls roſe again.

It is ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Five are fallen,</hi> that is, ſay they the firſt five, and that in the Apoſtles time, before he was in <hi>Patmos,</hi> but this is not ſo, for the Conſuls were not fallen in his time, for when <hi>Domitian</hi> was Emperour there were Conſuls ſtill, as <hi>Helvicus</hi> ſets them down by name, <hi>pag.</hi> 86, 87.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. What if the Words <hi>five are fallen</hi> be not meant of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles days, as indeed they are not, for the Apoſtles write a Prophecy, and not a Hiſtory, and in what ſenſe ſoever he ſpeaks, he is to be underſtood Prophetically, and not Hiſtorically, thus
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:180584:113"/>when 'tis ſaid, <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen, Rev.</hi> 14.8. the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, not that it was fallen in the Apoſtles days, for that is falſe; but the meaning is, that it ſhall fall hereafter in the time of the ſeventh Vial, and therefore <hi>ch.</hi> 18.21. the ſame thing is ſpoken of in the future tenſe, <hi>with violence ſhall that great City</hi> Babylon <hi>be thrown down, and ſhall be found no more at all.</hi> In like manner when 'tis ſaid <hi>five are fallen,</hi> the meaning is, not that <hi>five are fallen</hi> in the Apoſtles days, but the meaning is, that <hi>five are fallen</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſeventh Vial ſhall begin, and ſo whatever is ſpoken in that verſe, hath reference to the ſeventh Vial, and not to the days in which the Apoſtle lived.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. The ſeventh head is to <hi>continue but a ſhort ſpace, v.</hi> 10. now the Pope whom they reckon for the ſeventh head hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a long time, and how much longer he ſhall continue, who can tell? And if it be ſaid that this time is called ſhort in the ſight of God, or in reſpect of eternal happineſs; to this I anſwer, that it cannot be the meaning of it, for the other ſix heads did conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue but a ſhort ſpace in the ſight of God, or in reſpect of eternal happineſs, but of none of the ſeven heads is it ſaid that they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a ſhort ſpace but only of the ſeventh, and therefore the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that the ſeventh head ſhall continue a ſhort ſpace in reſpect of the other heads, but now the Popes have continued a long time, much longer then any of the other heads, and therefore they be not the ſeventh head.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. The Beaſt here ſpoken of, is not the ſeventh head, but the eighth; now the Pope is uſually counted for the ſeventh head, and therefore he is not the Beaſt that here is ſpoken of, and if he be not the Beaſt, where ſhall we find the Beaſt at <hi>Rome?</hi> Some to ſalve the matter, ſay that the <hi>Gothiſh</hi> Kingdom is the ſeventh head, and the Pope is the eighth, but this doth marr the matter quite; for if the <hi>Gothiſh</hi> Kingdom be the ſeventh head, the Pope muſt have a <hi>quietus eſt,</hi> for then he is none of the ſeven heads that here be ſpoken of, and if he be none of the ſeven,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:180584:114"/>then he is not the eighth, for the eighth is one of the ſeven, as appears <hi>v.</hi> 11.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. One of the ſeven heads fell and roſe again, and ſo became the eighth head, <hi>v.</hi> 11. but of none of the former mentioned heads can it be ſaid that they fell and roſe again, and ſo became the eighth head, and therefore they be not the heads here ſpoken of. The Popes did not fall and riſe again, and ſo become the eighth head, neither did the Emperours fall and riſe again, and ſo become the eighth head, and as for the Conſuls it is true, they fell and roſe again, but they be not the eighth head, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where ſhall we find the eighth head at <hi>Rome?</hi> And if the eighth head be not there, <hi>Rome</hi> is not the City that is meant in this place.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. <hi>The ten Horns be ten Kings which have received no Kingdom as yet, but receive power as Kings one hour with the Beaſt,</hi> v. 12. but where ſhall we find ten Kings belonging to the Pope, and riſing when he did? Divers men have ſtretched their wits to find them out, but with very ill ſucceſs; for what one ſaith another doth reject, and what another ſaith, a third doth contradict, ſo that none can tell who they be, and if this cannot be done, why may not men ſuſpend their Judgments, and take more time, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite before they give their verdict againſt the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo peremptorily as they do. And if it be ſaid that they of the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part can no more tell who theſe ten Kings be, then they of the Affirmative, to this I anſwer, that the caſe is not alike, for they which are for the Affirmative do hold the Prophecy, <hi>v.</hi> 12. to be paſt already, and that the ten Kings have received a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with the Beaſt already, and therefore it concerns them to tell who theſe ten Kings be, but they which be of the Negative part, do hold the Prophecy <hi>v.</hi> 12. to be Future, and that the ten Kings have not yet begun to Reign, and therefore it cannot be expected that they ſhould tell who theſe ten Kings be, before the Prophecy come to paſs.</p>

                     <p n="20">20. The words in the laſt verſe are not meant of the Apoſtles time, but of the time of the ſeventh Vial, ſo that we are not to look what City reigned in the Apoſtles time, for that was Heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> and not Papal, but we are to look what City reigned in the time of the ſeventh Vial, and that is the City which here is ſpoken of.</p>

                     <p>Laſtly, the Arguments for the Affirmative are not ſo valid as men do think they are, and as at firſt ſight they ſeem to be, which that it may the better appear, give me leave to tell you what may be ſaid unto them in this manner.</p>
                     <p>To the firſt one may deny the Minor,<note place="margin">Peganius <hi>in his genuine expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Viſions of the</hi> Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>pag.</hi> 145.193 <hi>and</hi> 337. <hi>leaves out the Tribunes, and puts the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvirs in their room, and if the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvirs be a head, then the ſeven heads in the ſecond Argument for the Affirmative be not reckoned right.</hi>
                        </note> and that for three reaſons. Firſt becauſe <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſtands on ſeven Hills at this day, as Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, <hi>lect. de Antichriſto pag.</hi> 178.2. Becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> though heretofore it had but ſeven Hills for a long time, yet in proceſs of time there were three more added to them, which made the number ten. 3. Becauſe the City of <hi>Rome</hi> that now is, ſtands on two Hills, and no more, and 'tis this new City which men count for <hi>Babylon,</hi> and not the old.</p>
                     <p>To the ſecond, one may deny both the Maior, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, Firſt one may deny the Maior, for as the ſeven Mountains, be not ſeven kinds of Mountains, but ſeven individual Mountains, and no more; ſo the ſeven Kings be not ſeven kinds of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, but ſeven individuals of one kind of Governours, and no
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:180584:115"/>more. 2. One may deny the Minor, for the Dictators, Kings, and Emperours made but one kind of Governours, differing in name, but not in form of Government, and therefore all that be reckoned in that Argument, be but five, and where then be the other two.</p>
                     <p>To the third, one may deny the Maior for the Apoſtle doth not mean that five were fallen in his time, for the Conſuls were not fallen then, but the meaning is, that five are fallen before the ſeventh Vial ſhall begin, ſo that what is ſpoken in that verſe hath reference to the execution of the ſeventh Vial, and not unto the Apoſtles time.</p>
                     <p>To the fourth, one may deny the Maior, for the Apoſtle doth not write a Hiſtory but a Prophecy, and therefore he ſpeaks not of the City which reigned over the Kings of the earth in his time, but he ſpeaks of the City which is to Reign over the Kings of the earth at the time of the ſeventh Vial, and look what City that is which reigneth over the Kings of the earth at the execution of that Vial, that's the City which is meant by <hi>Babylon</hi> in this place.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <hi>The preſent tenſe in Prophecies hath the ſignification of the future, as appears Rev.</hi> 11 7. <hi>the Beaſt that</hi> aſcendeth, <hi>that is, which</hi> ſhall aſcend. <hi>ſo v.</hi> 8. <hi>of this Chapter the Beaſt which thou ſaweſt,</hi> was, <hi>and</hi> is not, <hi>that is,</hi> ſhall be not, <hi>and afterwards ſhalt be again, ſo v.</hi> 11. <hi>he</hi> is <hi>the eighth, that is,</hi> ſhall be <hi>the eighth, and</hi> is <hi>of the ſeven, that is,</hi> ſhall be <hi>of the ſeven, and</hi> goeth, <hi>that is,</hi> ſhall go <hi>into Perdition, ſo v.</hi> 12. <hi>And the ten Horns which thou ſaweſt, are ten Kings which have received no Kingdom as yet, but</hi> receive, <hi>that is,</hi> ſhall receive <hi>power as Kings one hour with the Beaſt, and therefore we may well put this conſtruction on the laſt verſe, the City which</hi> reigneth, <hi>that is, which</hi> ſhall Reign <hi>over the Kings of the earth at the execution of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Vial, is the City which is meant by</hi> Babylon <hi>in this place.

                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> In the former Queſtion, I diſputed whether <hi>Babylon</hi> were the City of <hi>Rome</hi> or no, and though I would not adventure to ſay it is not <hi>Rome,</hi> yet I will be bold to ſay, it is not Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> paſt, and that for theſe reaſons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. No deſtruction did befall the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> till after the death of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> now in the days of <hi>Conſtantine, Rome</hi> ceaſed to be Heathen, and became Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The City here to be deſtroyed hath ſeven heads, that is, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Kings or Emperours, and no more, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.3.9. but Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <hi>Rome</hi> had more then ſeven Pagan Emperours, whereof <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſar</hi> was the firſt, and <hi>Maxentius</hi> was the laſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When ſhould the deſtruction here ſpoken of come to paſs, but in the time of the laſt head? Now there was no deſtruction of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Domitian,</hi> and yet he is reckoned by ſome, for the laſt head here ſpoken of.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If this be a Prophecy of the deſtruction of Heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> when ſhould it come to paſs but in the time of the Heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours?

                     <p n="5">5.

                     <p>Laſtly, no deſtruction of any City is like the deſtruction of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:180584:116"/>this City, and the wrath of God is not ſo heavy upon any City, as on this, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.19. therefore the deſtruction here ſpoken of, is not a partial deſtruction of the third part of the City only, nor a temporal deſtruction for a time only, but a total deſtruction and a final, which is not yet come to paſs.</p>

                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is not likely that St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of the ſame <hi>Babylon</hi> that St. <hi>John</hi> doth, ſeeing he writ his Epiſtle before the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was revealed to <hi>John,</hi> and therefore there want not ſome which ſay that St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks literally, and St. <hi>John</hi> myſtically. Certain it is, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of that <hi>Babylon</hi> which the Church was acquainted with when he wrote his Epiſtle, but neither he nor <hi>John,</hi> nor any other knew what myſtical <hi>Babylon</hi> meant at that time, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.6.7. but there were two other <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylons</hi> in the World which the Church was acquainted with, the one in <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> the other in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> from either of which St. <hi>Peter</hi> might write his Epiſtle, and not from <hi>Rome,</hi> as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and we have cauſe to think that he writ it from <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> becauſe St. <hi>Mark</hi> who was then Biſhop of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> is joined with him in the Salutation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.13.</p>

Theſe Viſions were not committed unto Writing in the time of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> as hath been proved before, <hi>Diſp.</hi> 1. <hi>q.</hi> 1. and therefore he is not the ſixth, or the <hi>One that is.</hi> 4. <hi>Galba</hi> reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but ſeven months, <hi>Otho</hi> but three months, <hi>Vitellius</hi> but eight months, and therefore <hi>Titus</hi> who reigned two years and two months, cannot be the ſeventh King, who was to ſtay but a little while, in reſpect of the other Kings, ſeeing he reigned longer then three of the former, though we put them altogether. 5. <hi>Titus</hi> the elder Son, was ſaluted Emperour after his Victory in

                     <p n="2">2. It is ſaid <hi>Verſ.</hi> 16. that they ſhall hate the Whore, but we do not find that they ſhall hate the Beaſt at all; and therefore the Beaſt and the Whore may be parted each from other.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Until the words of God ſhall be fulfilled,</hi> they give their Kingdom to the Beaſt; but the words of God are not fulfilled until the City be deſtroyed, and therefore they ſhall give their Kingdom to the Beaſt, until the City be deſtroyed; and how can that be done, unleſs the Beaſt and the City be at odds at that time?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. What is the cauſe, why they hate the Whore?

To make this plain by a compariſon: Suppoſe a Man ſhould ſay, The <hi>Scotchmen</hi> ſhall hate <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> and his Army, for God hath put in their hearts to give their Kingdom to the King. Doth not this imply, that the King, and <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> and his Army be at odds? In like manner, when it is ſaid, <hi>The ten horns ſhall hate the Whore,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For God hath put in their hearts, to give their Kingdom to the Beast.</hi> Doth not this imply, that the Beaſt and the Whore ſhall be at odds; ſo that the cleaving to the one, doth cauſe the hatred of the other.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Beaſt which carries the Whore, and is in love with her, doth not reach unto the eighth head, but to the ſeventh, and no further, as appears <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. And therefore it may well come to paſs, that all the ſeven heads may carry the Whore, and be in love with her; but the eighth head (which is the Beaſt we ſpeak of in this Queſtion) may hate her, and not carry her at all: And if it be ſaid, that the eighth head is of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſeven. To this I anſwer: So long as he is of that number, and under that notion or relation, he is one of them that carries the Whore, and is in love with her; but when he comes to be the eighth head of the Empire, he hath then a new relation, though he be the ſame man, and doth not carry the Whore at that time.</p>

                     <p n="7">7. It is likely, that the ſixth head is the ſame perſon that the eighth head is, and ſhall be depoſed by the City, while he is the ſixth head, and the ſeventh head ſhall be placed in his Throne; and in this reſpect it is, that the <hi>Beast was,</hi> and <hi>is not,</hi> and <hi>ſhall be; he was,</hi> in the time of the ſixth head; <hi>he is not,</hi> in the time of the ſeventh, for he is deſpoſed by the City, and the ſeventh placed in his room. And from hence it is, That the Beaſt, and the City be at odds, the ten Kings ſhall take part with the Beaſt againſt the City, and the City ſhall take part with the ſeventh head againſt the Beaſt, but the Beaſt, and the ten Kings ſhall prevail and deſtroy the ſeventh head, and the City both together.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have gone a way which no man went before, that I know of, if I be in the right, it is thy part gentle Reader to go the ſame way that I have gone; but if thou find, that I am in an error, and gone out of the right way, and canſt diſcover a better to me, I will follow thee therein.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Queſt. <hi>What uſe may be made of this Expoſition of the</hi> Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>in reſpect of War and Peace with Papists?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> We may not begin a War with Papiſts, thinking thereby to fulfil the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and ſee an end of them, and their Religion in our days, and that upon a trebble account.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, We have proved already, <hi>Diſp.</hi> 1 <hi>q.</hi> 3. That the chief ſcene of the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> is not <hi>Europe</hi> but <hi>Aſia;</hi> and therefore we may not look for the whole or chiefeſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the Prophecies in <hi>Europe,</hi> where the Papiſts are, but in <hi>Aſia</hi> rather, where the Papiſts are not.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, We have alſo ſhewed by divers Reaſons, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. <hi>q.</hi> 1. That it is very uncertain, whether <hi>Babylon</hi> be the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> or no; and therefore we may not begin a War with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:180584:122"/>thinking thereby to fulfil the Prophecies of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> upon that account: For put the caſe, that ſuch a War were begun, and it ſhould prove, in the end, that <hi>Babylon</hi> is not the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> as we thought it was, would we not be aſhamed of ſuch a War? Do not the Kings of the Earth bewail her, and lament for her, when they ſee the ſmoke of her burning; and would not this be our caſe, if we ſhould begin a War with <hi>Rome,</hi> thinking her to be the <hi>Babylon</hi> which the <hi>Revelation</hi> ſpeaketh of, would we not be ſorry, if in the iſſue, it ſhould fall out otherwiſe? Hear what the <hi>Wiſeman</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.18. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very purpoſe is establiſhed by counſel, and with good adviſe make War.</hi> Prov. 24.6. <hi>For by wiſe counſel ſhalt thou make thy War, and in multitude of counſellors there is ſafety.</hi> Let us therefore conſider of the matter, and examine the point a little better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we begin a War upon an uncertain ground, and repent thereof when it is done.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Suppoſe it to be true, that <hi>Babylon</hi> is the City of <hi>Rome</hi> indeed; yet for all this, we may not begin a War with Papiſts, thinking thereby that we fulfil the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and ſhall ſee an end of them and their Religion in our days; and that for theſe Reaſons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We are commanded to pray for the Peace of <hi>Jeruſalem, Pſal.</hi> 122.6. But how can we pray for her Peace, if we will have <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> begin a War with <hi>Babylon?</hi> Are not theſe two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary each to other? For when we pray for Peace, we are ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bally againſt War; but if we will have <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> begin a War with Papiſts, we are really for War, and not for Peace, which two ought not to be.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Bleſſed are the Peace-makers, for they ſhall be called the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, Matth.</hi> 5.9. Therefore curſed are the War-makers, for they be the children of the Devil, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.20, 21, 22, 23. <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.13, 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.7, 8.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>If it be poſſible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:180584:123"/>all men, Rom.</hi> 12.8. But how can we live peaceably with all men, if we begin a War with Papiſts? And how can it be ſaid that we be for Peace, as much as lieth in us, if we be the firſt beginners, fomenters, and contrivers of a War, and will not be at Peace when we may?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Follow Peace with all men, and Holineſs; without which, no man ſhall ſee the Lord, Heb.</hi> 12.14. But how do we follow Peace, if we begin a War with Papiſts, thinking thereby that we ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> before we know what the true meaning of them is? To which I will add another ſaying of the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace.</hi> Therefore Peace is not only to be admitted, when it may be had, or when it is offered to us and brought unto our doors; but we are to follow and ſeek after it our ſelves, when it is gone away from us; and not only ſo, but we are alſo to follow after the things which make for Peace, and conduce thereunto, and which may be a means to bring Peace to paſs.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>He that will love life, and ſee good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips, that they ſpeak no guile. Let him eſchue evil, and do good, let him ſeek Peace, and enſue it.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10, 11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.12, 13, 14. But how can we love life, and think to ſee good days? If we be the firſt that begin a War, and will not leave it off, till either all or moſt part of Chriſtendom be deſtroyed; for the Papacy doth take up the greateſt part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>From whence come wars and fightings among you? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                        </hi> 4.1. Therefore, though men pretend the accompliſhment of the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> yet it is rather to be thought, that <hi>libido dominandi,</hi> a deſire to rule is the cauſe of War, and a greedy mind after other mens poſſeſſions, is the cauſe thereof; and it is not the accompliſhment of the Prophecies of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                        <pb n="239" facs="tcp:180584:123"/>but the Revenues of the Church which has an inlet to ſuch a War as this is.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>And then ſhall that wicked man be revealed, whom the Lord ſhall conſume with the ſpirit of his mouth, and ſhall utterly destroy with the brightneſs of his coming,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.8. Now, who is the man of ſin? You will be ready to ſay it is the Pope, but what is meant by the ſpirit of his mouth? But the Preaching of the Goſpel, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.16. Therefore the man of ſin ſhall not be conſumed by War, but by Preaching of the Word. To which I may add that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5. <hi>For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds, casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. <hi>For the Word of God is quick and powerful and ſharper then any two edged ſword, giving even to the dividing aſunder of ſoul and ſpirit, and of joynts and marrow, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</hi> Here be the Weapons by which Chriſtians ſhould fight, and by which, the man of ſin ſhall be conſumed; and that is, by the Word of God, and by the ſpirit of his mouth. And as for the time when this ſhall be accompliſhed, it is <hi>at the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his coming;</hi> and what is meant by the brightneſs of his coming, but the day of judgment? And therefore the man of ſin ſhall not have a final end, until the day of judgment, when Chriſt ſhall come in perſon and deſtroy him; and if any man doth think that he ſhall live to ſee it done before, he feeds himſelf with vain hopes, and has no ground to think that it ſhall come to paſs. See <hi>Manlius Accompliſhment of Prophecies, pag.</hi> 148, 166, 167.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>And when they ſhall have finiſhed their Teſtimony, the Beaſt that aſcended out of the bottomleſs Pit ſhall make War againſt them, and ſhall overcome them, and kill them,</hi> Rev. 11.7, 8, 9. Therefore
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:180584:124"/>the two witneſſes do not begin a War with the Beaſt, but he begins with them and prevails therein; this were enough to deter us from ſeeking or beginning War with Papiſts, leſt we meet with the ſame Cataſtrophe that the two Witneſſes are ſaid to meet with in this Prophecy; for if God delivered them into the Beaſts hands, who were his peculiar Prophets and had ſuch eminent power to work Miracles as they had, <hi>v.</hi> 4.5.6. What hope or ground have we to think that he will not deliver us if we begin a War with Papiſts, and will not be quiet when we may? To which may be added, that when the two Witneſſes revived and returned to life again, they did not renew the War with the Beaſt, neither was the Beaſt or any of his men ſlain by them, or by their procurement that we read of; but by an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake which it pleaſed God to ſend amongſt them, and when the tenth part of the City fell, it fell by reaſon of the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and not by their means or procurement, and in the Earthquake were ſlain ſeven thouſand men and no more, <hi>v.</hi> 13. which makes not a total nor a final deſtruction of the Beaſt, but a partial and a temporal only.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>And it was given him to make War with the Saints, and to overcome them,</hi> Rev. 13.7. Here you ſee the Beaſt begins a War with the Saints, and not the Saints with him; and there is a time ſet by God in which the Beaſt ſhall prevail againſt the Saints, and this time is ſaid to be forty two moneths, <hi>v.</hi> 5. but can we tell that this time is over, for if it be not over we may not think to prevail, and if we think it is over, what ground have we for that? we had need be ſure of it before hand, leſt inſtead of overcoming we be overcome. Perhaps it may be ſaid that the Vials are begun already, and that is ſome ground to think that the forty two moneths are ended; to this I anſwer, no, following their own interpretation of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> for they think themſelves (but falſely) that the Vials were begun in the time of the Witneſſes when they wrought

And he would wager half the eſtate he had, that it ſhould come to paſs; but he lived to ſee his Prophecy come to nought: So they which thought the Beaſt ſhould have an end in the year 1666. did the like.

Which they would not do, if they were not of her Religion ſtill; and becauſe they cannot commit fornication any more in that particular place, they ſhall ſeek to do it elſwhere. 3. Though this deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on puts an end unto the Whore, yet it ſhall not put an end unto the Beaſt; for after this is done, the Beaſt ſhall continue ſtill, and find another reſt, as the Popes have done already; ſome of whom, had their ſeats at <hi>Avignion</hi> in <hi>France</hi> for ſeventy years together, and yet were Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> while they were in that place; yea, after this is done, the Beaſt ſhall have a puiſſant Army ſtill, which ſhall put the Church in ſuch a hazard, that Chriſt himſelf ſhall come in perſon and deſtroy him, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.20. 4. Suppoſe we all this to be true, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Babylon</hi> is the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Pope, the Beaſt that here is ſpoken of.

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:180584:127"/>our days, and put an end unto the Beaſt, in reſpect of Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and Eccleſiaſticks too; yet when all this is granted, a Queſtion may be made, What Commiſſion had theſe Kings to patroniſe this War, and what they do therein, for this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy gives them none: It is a Prophecy, what ſhall be <hi>de facto,</hi> not what ſhall be <hi>de jure;</hi> it tells us what ſhall come to paſs <hi>actually,</hi> by main force and violence, not what ſhall come to paſs <hi>legally,</hi> according to the Law of God. And when it is ſaid <hi>Verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>That God hath put into their hearts to fulfil his will.</hi> We may not think that this is meant of his commanding will, but of his decreeing will, and ſo the original words do ſignifie, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> his pleaſure, ſentence, or decree. Now it is the firſt of theſe, which gives Commiſſion for the doing of a thing, and not the ſecond; and it is the firſt of theſe, that we muſt walk and act by, and not the ſecond. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> did fulfil the Will of God, that is, The decree of God in deſtroying of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but yet he ſinned againſt God in doing it, for want of a Commiſſion from the Will of Precept. And no other is the caſe of theſe Kings, for God hath put into their hearts to fulfil his will, that is, his decree; but as for his Will of Precept, they fulfil it not. 5. This War is not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by the ten Kings, in behalf of Religion, but for ſome politick end or other, and it may be queſtioned, Whether the Beaſt himſelf hath not a hand in this War, and whether the Beaſt and the City may not be at odds at this time; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ten Kings ſhall not give their Kingdom to the Beaſt on that occaſion, and ſo deſtroy the City upon that account. Read the 16 and 17 <hi>Verſes,</hi> and conſider of it. 6. The Churches troubles are not ended, when this War againſt the Whore is over. Is not the <hi>Turk</hi> as great an enemy to Religion as the Pope, and as potent too? And put the caſe the Pope were dead, and the City burnt to aſhes, what ſhall we do unto the <hi>Turk</hi> when this is done? Shall we think to deſtroy him too, as
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:180584:127"/>we do the Pope? Let us conſider firſt, which ſhall be deſtroyed firſt; for if the <hi>Turk</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed firſt, why begin we with the Papiſt, and let the <hi>Turk</hi> alone? but if the Pope ſhall be deſtroyed firſt, then mark what will follow. Firſt it will follow, that the Pope is not the Beaſt, for the Beaſt ſhall be deſtroyed laſt of all, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.20. Secondly, it will follow, that the troubles of the Churches are not ended, when the Pope is dead; for the <hi>Turk</hi> is ſtill alive, who hath made more havock of the Churches in the Eaſt, then ever the Pope did in the Weſt. 7. Put the caſe once more, that the Whore were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the ten Kings, what think we of the <hi>Turk,</hi> when this is done? ſhall not he have an end too? And if he ſhall, why do we not war with him too upon preſumption, that we be the perſons that ſhall put an end unto him? Is it not rather to be feared, that if Chriſtians war with Chriſtians, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy one another, the <hi>Turk</hi> may become Maſter of the Weſt, as he is already of the Eaſt, eſpecially if we conſider, that he came unto this height in which he is, by the wars of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians among themſelves. 8. If it be lawful to have Peace with the <hi>Turk,</hi> why not alſo with the Pope? I ſuppoſe they will not ſay, but that our Peace with the <hi>Turk</hi> is a lawful Peace, and why not alſo with the Pope? <hi>Pax cum hominibus, cum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis bellum,</hi> is a true and ſafe rule to go by, we may and ought to be at Peace with the Men, and at War only with the falſe Religion of the Men<note n="*" place="bottom">Hear what <hi>Aretius</hi> ſaith of making War upon Papiſts. <hi>Judaei expulerunt jure Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeos impias gentes: Ergo &amp; nobis licet Papiſtas idololatras expellere, non ſcquitur quia diſſimilitudo eſt.
